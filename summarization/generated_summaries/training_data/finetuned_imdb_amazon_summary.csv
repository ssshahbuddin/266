0,"I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn't have much of a plot"
1,risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level.
2,This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story. One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive.
3,"This film was probably inspired by Godard's Masculin, féminin and I urge you to see that film instead. A movie of its time, and place"
4,"Oh, brother...after hearing about this ridiculous film for umpteen years all I can think of is that old Peggy Lee song..brbr""Is that all there is??""...I was just an early teen when this smoked"
5,One of the worst films I've ever seen! I've never seen a film that was so unwatchable! I've never seen a film that was so unwatchable!
6,"I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of..."
7,"Rachel York's portrayal of Lucille Ball is absolutely awful. Danny Pino's portrayal of Desi Arnaz is horrible. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in ""Before the Laughter"" is much better compared to this."
8,"Peter Bogdanovich's ""They All Laughed"" is a waste of time, money, and talent... but it's a good movie anyway."
9,"Peter Bogdonavitch's out-of-touch, out-of-touch, out-of-touch, out-of-touch, out-of-touch, out-of-touch, out-of-touch"
10,"It was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with."
11,"It's a waste of time, money, and talent. It's a waste of time, money, and talent. It's a waste of time. It's a waste of talent. It's a waste of"
12,"Never cast models and Playboy bunnies in your films! Bob Fosse's ""Star 80"" about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-"
13,"Its not the cast. A finer group of actors, you could not find. Its not the setting. The director is in love with New York City, and by the end of the film, so are we all!"
14,"""They All Laughed"" is a very boring movie. I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten)"
15,Don't watch this movie! Don't watch it! Don't watch it! Don't watch it! Don't watch it! Don't watch it! Don't watch it! Don't watch it
16,One of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of her last movies. I'll always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.
17,"One of the worst films I've seen in a long, long time........"
18,"I think I will make a movie next weekend. Oh wait, I'm working..oh I'm sure I can fit it in. It looks like whoever made this film fit it in. I hope the makers of this crap"
19,TZC is the worst movie I've ever seen. TZC is the worst movie I've ever seen. TZC is the worst movie I've ever seen. TZC is the worst movie I'
20,"If you're going to make a zombie movie, don't waste your time and money on this one. brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr"
21,"Mindless 3-D movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle. And yes, we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!!"
22,"The worst 3D movie I've ever seen, and it's nudity-free............"
23,"One of the worst zombie movies I've seen in a long time, and I've seen it in 3D too. I give it 2/10, but raise my rating to 3 since I didn't get to view it with"
24,"Don't waste your money, don't waste your time, don't waste your money, don't waste your time, don't waste your money, don't waste your time, don't waste your money"
25,"This was the worst film I have ever seen. Never has a film had so many mistakes in it. My girlfriend left it here, so now I live with the shame of owning this piece of crap."
26,Don't waste your time and money on this one... it's not even a popcorn film.............
27,I've been able to sit and watch this film TWICE!!! I loved it all the way through!!! I've been able to watch it TWICE!!!
28,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long, long time........."
29,this movie sucks.....................
30,"I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight"
31,I can't tell where I was in this movie. I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3d which I did not watch.
32,"One of Brad's better films, but it's not quite as good as his other films, but it's still a good one......."
33,"An ABSOLUTE waste of time, hobbled from the outset by Haggerty's painfully amateurish performance in a key role. Worse still, the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine."
34,One of the worst horror films I've ever seen...........
35,I can't believe that I spent $5 on this movie. I am a huge zombie fanatic and thought the movie couldn't be that bad? Was I wrong!
36,"The worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones. To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones."
37,I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark.
38,"""Love's Abiding Joy"" is not the book it is titled after in any way, but it does not follow the book in any way!"
39,"Not as good as the other movies in the series, but it's a good family movie, too many scenes out of context, too many scenes out of context."
40,"Not as good as the book,but not as bad as it could have been. I don't read the book,but I don't read the movie."
41,"Low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film that doesn't do much for a Christian audience. I'm not a Southern Baptist, but I must give it a below average rating."
42,"One of the worst B-movies I've seen in a long, long time......."
43,I was a kid and so I was a bit dumb. Even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people.
44,"One of the worst films I've seen in a long time, and I've seen it more than once....."
45,"This movie sucks. It really was a waste of my life. Like I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Don't let your girlfriend talk you into watching it"
46,This was a waste of two hours of my life. Can I get them back? I would have rather scraped my face against a brick wall for two hours then soaked it in peroxide.
47,"I am surprised at the high ratings for this movie. I found it to be absolutely idiotic. The mother gets ""visions"" when she touches certain things or people? And one thing she touched twice made her vision continue..."
48,Not as good as the book but not as bad as it could have been........
49,"This was by far the worst of the series, and I'd have to say that it was by far the worst of it's kind. I just wanted to warn others not to start with this one."
50,"Not as good as I thought it would be, but not as bad as I thought it would be......"
51,"It's not the best of the best, but it's not the worst of the worst. It's not the worst of the worst. It's not the worst of the worst."
52,"An over-hyped, over-hyped, over-hyped, over-hyped, over-hyped, over-hyped, over-hyped, over-hyped, over-hyped, over-hyped, over-hyped, over-hyped"
53,"It's not the Robin Hood story, it's not Beowulf, and it's not the true history of Ned Kelly, it's just a fantasy"
54,This has to be the worst piece of garbage I've seen in a while. I wish I'd known that he and Naomi Watts are an item in real life because I spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what she
55,"""Ned Kelly"" feels awfully familiar and unoriginal as it pays homage to any number of the genre's clichés on its way to the inevitable showdown"
56,"This movie was so unrelentingly bad, I could hardly believe I was watching it. The directing, editing, production, and script all seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who don't know all that much about"
57,This movie was slow moving and never pulled me in. I failed to develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to fast-forward just to get to the end.
58,"I thought this was a very clunky, uninvolving version of a famous Australian story. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good in their roles, and gave their characters some personality..."
59,It's an Australian story yet it seems like it was set in America. Also Ned was an Australian yet he has an Irish accent...it is the worst film I have seen in a long time
60,"The political theme of this film is so obvious and heavy handed, that the outcome is entirely predictable. I found the film a real chore to watch. It is the direction for modern films, and this one put me off watching any more."
61,"Not as good as I thought it would be, but it's still a good film, and Ledger does a good job as Ned Kelly, but not as good as I thought it would be"
62,I don't get the rating for The Amati Girls and I think I was REALLY kind giving it a 4 out of 10. What could otherwise have been a wonderful story with actually a set of more or less decent actors became a total
63,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long, long time...and I've seen more than one..I've seen more than one..I've seen more than one..I've seen"
64,"This is the worst film I have seen in a long time. I am pretty sure this film got upto a six because people think they should like it. Well, maybe that's a bit deceptive since steam rising from a fresh pile sounds"
65,"SWING! is an important film, but it's also a mess. The writing is just god-awful and a bit trashy at times."
66,"""The Sunshine Boys"" is the title of Neil Simon's sole ironic moment in this film. Simon equates old age with irrational behavior--and, worse, clumsy, galumphing, mean-spirited irrational behavior."
67,"I'm glad to have another Goldie Hawn movie, but I'm not sure it was worth the money I paid for it! I don't like stupid comedies!"
68,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long, long time........"
69,Not so much a satire as a vehicle for Goldie Hawn to show off her brand of platitudes and charm. Sunny turns from a blonde bimbo into a fount of political wisdom.
70,"What does the "" Executive producer "" do in a movie. If I remember correctly it's the person who raised the financial backing to make the movie."
71,One of Goldie Hawn's worst movies...but she's still the star........
72,One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. 
73,The only good thing about this movie was the shot of Goldie Hawn standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other depraved women from removing her skimpy little cotton top while she giggled and cooed.
74,"Well-made, well-photographed, well-acted, well-acted, well-acted, well-acted, well-photographed, well-acted, well-acted, well-acted, well-acted, well-"
75,"The Spanish Civil War, like every war, was horrible. The revenge, a very human behavior, not pretty at all. But what Mr Villaronga try, is a pseudo tragedy that can belongs to the worst of the film "
76,this film was a major letdown. the level of relentless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing. some scenes were truly unnecessarily ugly and mean-spirited.
77,One of the worst horror films I've seen in a long time.........
78,"A very cheesy and dull road movie. The cast is wasted, the writing is stupid and pretentious. The only thing worthwhile is the top-notch Lalo Schifrin's soundtrack."
79,"Not Matthew Mconaughey's best work, but he's great in ""A Time to kill"", ""Frailty"", ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"", ""Edtv"" and ""Ami"
80,"Franco is the king of so-called 'eurotrash', but Devil Hunter is the worst of his films. It's just plain stupid."
81,One of the video nastiest movies I have ever seen. I finally found it on DVD at the end of last year. It is a very low budget movie
82,"One of the worst Video Nasties I've ever seen, and I've seen it more than once......."
83,"One of the worst 'horror' films I've seen in a long, long time......."
84,"This video nasty was initially banned in Britain, and allowed in last November without cuts. It features the Playboy Playmate of the Month October 1979, Ursula Buchfellner."
85,"One of Jess Franco's worst films, but it's better than the other two. Depends on who you ask. Depends on who you ask. Depends on who you ask. Depends on."
86,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a loooong.. and I've seen it many times........
87,Not the best of the Jess Franco films but not bad at all............
88,The worst Euro-cannibal movie I've ever seen..........
89,"A bit better than CANNIBALS, but still not as good as Severin's               "
90,"It's on the DPP's 'Video Nasty' list, but it really needn't have been. Many films on the list where there for God (and DPP) only known reasons"
91,Not as good as I thought it would be but still worth seeing for the zombie/cannibal gore. The film was a little too long for me.
92,"One of the worst horror films I've seen in a long time & Franco is the worst director I've seen in a long, long time!"
93,STUPID! STUPID!!! STUPID!!! STUPID!!! STUPID!!! STUPID!!! STUPID!!! STUPID!!! STUPID!!! STUPID!!! STUPID!!! STUPID!!!
94,"This is the worst thing the TMNT franchise has ever spawned. I was a kid when this came out and I still thought it was deuce, even though I liked the original cartoon."
95,"One of those oddities in Turtledom that is best left buried and forgotten. As it stands, Next Mutation is one of those oddities in Turtledom that is best left buried and forgotten."
96,"This is the biggest insult to TMNT ever. Fortunantely, officially Venus does not exist in canon TMNT. There will never be a female turtle, this took away from the tragic tale of 4 male unique mutants who will never have a family"
97,The female turtle is not a good idea to have in the new series.........
98,I cannot stay indifferent to Lars van Trier's films. I consider 'Breaking the Waves' nothing less than a masterpiece. I loved 'Dancer in the Night'
99,Don't even bother to read this review - don't even bother to watch it. It's a waste of time and money. Don't even bother to read it.
100,Terrible movie. Nuff Said. These Lines are Just Filler. The movie was bad. Why I have to expand on that I don't know. This is already a waste of my time.
101,Don't waste your time and money on this movie...it's a waste of time and money...it's a waste of money...it's a waste of time...it's a waste of money...it'
102,One of the worst movies I've ever seen...........
103,Don't waste your time and money on this one.. it's a waste of time and money.. it's a waste of money.. it's a waste of time..
104,"I rented this one on DVD without any prior knowledge. I was suspicious seeing Michael Madsen appearing in a movie I have never heard of, but it was a freebie, so..."
105,This is not a bad movie as everybody are so anxious to present as.. It makes you think-in my case even meditate- and there are a lot of movies outthere that doesn't give even that affect..
106,What was with all the Turkish actors? No offense but I thought it was all for nothing for all these actors. The film had no script to test any actors acting skill or ability. It demanded next to nothing I bought this film to see
107,"it's the good kind of bad movie. the one you keep watching just to see how much worst could it will get, so that later you can tell other people how you couldn't believe how terrible the movie was."
108,"Good acting, bad direction, bad sound effects, but Arnold Vosloo makes the film viewable......."
109,"This is an art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972 (the National Film Preservation Foundation says 1969 and IMDb says 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period--with"
110,It's just not my cup of tea. It's just not my cup of tea. It's about 812 minutes too long.
111,Good-looking people don't always make a good movie..........
112,This is the worst movie ever made. Ever. It beats everything. I have never seen worse. Retire the trophy and give it to these people.....there's just no comparison.
113,"Save your money, save your time... do anything else... this film has no redeeming qualities. Save your money, save your time... do anything else..."
114,"Weak plot, predictable violence, only semi interesting characters. Like the writer (also one of the stars?) was fictionalizing his own screw ups and added an incredulous fantasies of drugs and murder to make it ""hot"""
115,"Don't waste your time, money or money on this movie. It's B-grade slop.........."
116,"I'm not sure what ""Reload"" is, but I'm pretty sure it's not ""Loaded""<n>I'm not sure what ""Reload"" is, but I'm pretty sure it's"
117,"This film had a lot of promise, and the plot was relatively interesting, however the actors, director and editors seriously let this film down. The acting is wooden, very few of the characters are believable."
118,One of the dumbest films I've ever seen. It rips off nearly ever type of thriller and manages to make a mess of them all. I honestly cant understand how this type of nonsense gets produced and actually released.
119,"Don't waste your time with this movie. It may be too much. Characters are so over exaggerated than they can ever be in real life and some pretty unexplainable stuff happens ""storywise"", not in good way."
120,This is really a new low in entertainment. Even though there are a lot worse movies out.brbr So all in all i... just... can't recommend it.
121,This movie is a total waste of time and effort. I guess he was trying to make a stylish movie. Any way I think this movie is a total waste of time and effort.
122,CHACE IS THE BEST!!! But CHACE IS NOT THE BEST!!! But CHACE IS THE BEST!!! But CHACE IS THE BEST!!! But CHACE IS THE BEST!!!
123,"Price is the only reason to watch this thriller. Supporting cast includes Patrick O'Neal, Mary Murphy, Eva Gabor and Jay Novello.<n>Price is a little below par compared to his masterpieces, but is still the only reason to"
124,An adaptation of Pat Barker's 'Union Street'...no...no...no...no...no...no...no...no...no...no...no...no...no...no...no...no...no...no...
125,"One of the worst 20 movies for its budget level that I have ever seen. I give it 1 out of 10, truly one of the worst 20 movies for its budget level that I have ever seen."
126,"DeNiro is the most intelligent illiterate of all time. This movie is so wasteful of talent, it is truly disgusting. Jane Fonda's character is a caricature of herself, and not a funny one."
127,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time but it's a waste of time and money. It's one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.
128,"Disappointing, but not as bad as I thought it would be........."
129,"I hate thee, I hate thee, I hate thee, I hate thee, I hate thee, I hate thee, I hate thee, I hate thee, I hate thee, I hate the"
130,"It's a Takashi Miike movie, but it's not a great one. brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr"
131,"Uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in a handsome but bland adaptation, in which dialogue seems recited rather than heartfelt, and cash strapped appearances by the ghosts fail to round up any sense of awe or magic"
132,"Not as good as the book, but not as bad as I thought it would be......."
133,Disappointed in Scott's performance as Scrooge. Alistair Sim portrayed the role infinitely better. Very disappointing. Even the musical version (and frankly the Muppets) take on this are better executed.
134,"This movie is so bad, I almost fell asleep. I can't stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line: ""Merry Christmas to everyone!"""
135,"When will the hurting stop? I never want to see another version of a Christmas Carol again. They keep on making movies with the same story, falling over each other in trying to make the movie better then the..."
136,"I don't like it, but I don't hate it either. I've seen way better from ''The Simpsons'''. I've seen way better from ''The Simpsons'''"
137,"MYSTERIOUS PLANET is a home movie, not a sci-fi film. The sound editing is pretty bad. The special effects are imaginative. Sort of like Karl Zeman animation in JOURNEY TO BEGINNING OF TIME (1955"
138,"Beyond a shadow of a doubt Mysterious Planet is one of the worst movies ever made, yet retains an affection in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and astoundingly awful sound track combine to create something that is..."
139,"The world's funniest human in this dull little cartoon. Betty, long past her prime, thanks to the Production Code, is running a pet shop and leaves Henry in charge of..."
140,"William Russ is the main character throughout this made for TV movie. He left his family behind to only reappear and begin paying off his debts. Thats where Peter Falk (Colombo) comes in, playing several different roles, to convince him"
141,"""Finding John Christmas"" is the worst Christmas film I've seen in a long, long time. brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr"
142,"One of Sooraj Barjatya's better films, but not as good as his previous ones......"
143,"Vivah, Vivah! Vivah! Vivah! Vivah! Vivah! Vivah! Vivah! Vivah! Vivah! Vivah! Vivah! Vivah! Vivah! Vivah! Vivah!"
144,"This movie is a dream. Happy family, one cruel woman, good in-laws and a man who loves her to death. In HAHK Anupam Kher was the poor bride's father and now it's vice versa"
145,"A Cinderella story made for adults who live in dreamland. The romance is very unrealistic, fluttery, lovey dovey, perfect etc. The Cinderella plot till the very end and Shahid Kapoor is the only reason for my stars."
146,"Not as good as ""The Tailor of Panama"", but not as bad as ""The Tailor of Panama"", but not as good as ""The Tailor of Panama"""
147,"""I've got these lemmings hooked so bad that I can crank out the worst piece of stinking, putrid garbage that I could dream up, and they'll flock to the theaters to scarf it up"""
148,Fine cast cannot uplift this routine tale of a secretary murdered by her married paramour. In fact there are more questions than answers in this one-sided tale of romance and murder
149,"This film was choppy, incoherent and contrived. It was also an extremely mean-spirited portrayal of women. I rented it because it was listed as a comedy (that's a stretch)"
150,"This film is a calculated attempt to cash in the success of Sex in the City and Four Weddings and a Funeral. In fact, if they'd called it Sex at a Funeral, they might have done better at the box office."
151,Andie's acting is so bad in this film - I could not connect with them or feel there love for each other. The other 2 women however were very good and overshadowed Andie. Anyway this was such a campy movie.
152,"Andie's character falls for the young organ player who used to be her student when he was 14 (she's the headmistress of an English school, believe it or not)"
153,"This was awful. Andie Macdowell is a terrible actress. So wooden she makes a rocking horse look like it could do a better job. But then remember that turn in Four Weddings, equally as excruciating"
154,"Can't believe the positive reviews! Am I the only one who thought these ""ladies"" were anything but? Kate tells Jed she could get fired because she's supposed to be a pillar of the community, but puts out for"
155,"I thought it was a comedy: wrong! It's a drama.... Well, up to the last third, because after the story becomes totally ""abracadabrantesque"", the symbolic word for a French presidential mandate."
156,Is this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama? It's too late. Truly a lesson (for British filmmakers anyway) of how not to make films
157,Andie McDowell is beautiful as the 40-ish woman whose late start at a serious relationship leads her to a considerably younger man and a subsequenet falling-out with 2 long-time best girldfriends.
158,"SPOILER: The young lover, Jed, is kicked out by the spinster, Kate (Andie McDowell), because she wrongly believes that Jed is having an affair with one of her two catty girlfriends."
159,"The worst thing about Crush is not that it's acted pretty bad, or that the plot is virtually non-existent. It's not even that bad that the camerawork could have been better."
160,"One of the worst films ever made by a male director about woman. Director Andy McKay simply doesn't know woman. Peaks of bad taste, American Pie's humor style, crude story, no sense, groundless story, refuted characters"
161,I wish I could get my money back for the DVD rental -- I also want those 112 minutes of my life back. What a ripoff. What a ripoff.
162,"A shame of a waste of time, effort and money..........."
163,"""The Crush"" is a pleasant enough 40-something friends romantic chick flick for the first two-thirds or so, as it tries to be a Brit ""Sex and the City"""
164,not a good movie...not a good idea...not a good movie...not a good idea...not a good idea...not a good movie...not a good idea...
165,"The story sounds good and if you've read the novel, then you're probably expecting a deep and intense movie that could offer some insight for some interesting and insufficiently explored human relationships."
166,"This is a movie that relies solely on the somewhat controversial image of incest and lesbianism to get noticed.That is it.The dialogs are pathetic and the sensuality of the ""sex scenes"" is absolutely absent."
167,"I am not so much like Love Sick as I image. Finally the film express sexual relationship of Alex, kik, Sandu their triangle love were full of intenseness, frustration and jealous"
168,"I am not so much like Love Sick as I image. Finally the film express sexual relationship of Alex, kik, Sandu their triangle love were full of intenseness, frustration and jealous"
169,Not worth the time and money spent on it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
170,"It could have been a good movie. A love biangle, (sorry for the poetical license, but is not a triangle!) an interesting story, unfortunately badly told"
171,"""Beat Street"" is still a pretty dull show. Again this pic is really only cashing in on the 'breakin' craze but at least we get a little bit of entertainment from the plot"
172,"Hilariously obvious ""drama"" about a bunch of high school (I think) kids who enjoy non-stop hip-hop, break dancing, graffiti and trying to become a dj at the Roxy--or something"
173,Wild Style and Style Wars are original Hip Hop. This is overproduced and has a Hollywood sauce. Rather look for the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto. They have convey the grittiness that comes with life in the
174,"The worst movie I've seen in a long, long time. Don't waste your time watching this movie. Don't waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie. Don't waste your time watching this movie."
175,Horrible film with bits of the Ramones strewn about. Your worse than average 1970's/80's comedy format of the cool kids taking over the school with some whimsical plan.
176,"What kind of high school is this anyway?brbrUnless you are a major Ramones fan, DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT waste your time like I did. This is utterly unwatchable from start to finish."
177,Don't waste your time or money on this film. Don't waste your time or money on this film (like I did) you will be sorely disappointed.
178,"What a disappointment. Chamberlain's nearly expressionless mask of a face offered little but confused disbelief, something I found myself mirroring as the film wore on."
179,"The perfect murder is foiled when a wife(played by Mary Ellen Trainor) who murders her husband with a poker, has the misfortune of receiving a visitor as she is about to move the body outside..an escaped insane madman dressed in"
180,"""La Maman et La Putain"" has passed into history as an influence on much of what's been done in France and elsewhere in the past thirty years and no one interested in the history of film should be dissuaded from watching"
181,"Not the sound of bees, that's the effect induced by watching this extremely long, extremely boring, badly acted movie. How I ever made it through all 3 1/2 hours without falling asleep I'll never know."
182,Iberia is nice to see on TV. But why see this in silver screen? Lot of dance and music. If you like classical music or modern dance this could be your date movie. But otherwise one and half hour is just too long time

187,"This movie is flawed on many fronts. Like many before it, it portrays more of the mythology of the Alamo than the history. The production is poor, overall giving the impression of a welfare project for lots of actors who might have otherwise"
188,Slow and riddled with inaccuracy. Over-looking its flaws this is still an interesting account of the famed and heroic siege of the Alamo during the Texas fight for independence from Mexico.
189,The Alamo:Thirteen Days to Glory is a waste of time and money. It's a waste of time. It's a waste of time. It's a waste of money. It's a waste of time.
190,Redford's version of Norman Maclean's masterpiece is a mediocrity. He adds banal scenes of the Maclean brothers going over a falls and of them double-dating in a seedy bar that were not even hinted at in the story.
191,The only good part about this film is the beautiful scenery. The minister should have retired from the pulpit the time his son Paul strayed from the teachings he proclaimed. How many times can his boys take the Lord's name in vain in this
192,"""A river runs through it"" certainly is a well made movie from a cineastic stand-point. Great landscapes, Redford acting well. Unfortunately, the story is bad (if there is a story at all)"
193,"Not as good as ""The Fast And The Furious"", but not as bad as ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" or ""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack Of The Clones"""
194,This movie has beautiful scenery. Unfortunately it has no plot. In order to have a plot there must be a conflict. This movie had none. It spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and failed to ever place any activity in it.

198,"One of the best westerns of all time, but it's not as good as any of Mann's other films....."
199,"Not even remotely like the Canadian side of the border during the Klondike gold rush. Mr. Mann and company appear to have mistaken Dawson City for Deadwood, the Canadian North for the American Wild West."
200,"One of the best Westerns I've seen in a long time, but it's not as good as I'd like it to be."
201,This is the worst sequel on the face of the world of movies. Once again it doesn't make since. The killer still kills for fun. And this time he is killing people that are making a movie about what happened in the first

207,"What was the deal with trying to kill off the cast? No cast, no movie. He wanted it to ""look real when they died""? Woooooow (sarcasm)"
208,Unbelievably Disappointed in Return of Return to The Cabin by the Lake........
209,'Return to Cabin by the Lake' is a useless movie. The acting was not good and the plot wasn't even remotely interesting. Judd Nelson was very good in the first film and put a whole lot more into his character than in
210,"A decent sequel, but does not pack the punch of the original. A murderous screenwriter(Judd Nelson)assumes new identities in order to direct his own novel CABIN BY THE LAKE. Still ruthless killing, but movie seems very tongue"
211,One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. I'll never watch it again. I don't even want to watch it.

220,Turturro's Luzhin looks like a bad Rain Man impression and the portrayal of the genius as a semi-autistic man was annoying. Overall it seems as if this film is trying to hard and ends up looking pompous in
221,"a movie that attempts to be far smarter than its makers are capable of producing. in all worth a lazy watch on a really boring day, but don't fret if you miss this one."
222,Not even campy for a mid 1950s sexless love story. And the problem is that Hollywood made such a big deal about Pat Boone's refusal to kiss a woman not his wife on screen before its release that the audience knows he

229,Don't waste your time or money on this movie. It's a waste of your time and money. It's a waste of your money. It's a waste of your money.
230,"This is a film in which black people are naturally childlike, readily and happily accepting their social conditions. A film in which black people are over-sexed, sensualists dominated by violent passions."
231,"I'm sorry, but Spielberg didn't deserve to win any Oscar for this piece, and I think the Academy was right in that vote. But it would be hard to justify, given what they were told to do and what you"

254,I Am Curious is really two films in one - half of it is the sexual experimental side of Lena and the other half is her curiosity with political/socialism
255,"One of the best films of the 60's, but has been reduced by time to a mere curiosity....."
256,Why is the sound so bad? Could've earned a 6. Could've earned a 6. Could've earned a 6. Could've earned a 6.
257,This is the ultimate limit in utter sacrifice made by Indian Woman!!brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
258,What really bothered me was the makers' absurd notion of surrogate mother. A whore who conceives a child with someone after have sex with the man (of the family desiring a child) is not a surrogate mother.
259,I wonder if there is any sense of sense in this movie.. Its a big joke. Good.. Its entertaining.. You get to see the most stupid plot played very seriously in the form of a film..

265,Blank check is one of those kids movies that could have been a great suspense thriller for the kids but instead it's a tired lame home alone ripoff that isn't worth a dime
266,Blank Check isn't a bad film but it's not entertaining either. (Or at least it isn't to anyone over the age of 6) Blank Check isn't a entertaining film because nothing about it is original.
267,"One of the emptiest movies I've ever seen. For one thing, it's too unbelievable. I draw the line at a twelve-year-old boy going out with a thirty-year-old woman."

288,It's time to get this movie out of the way before it's too late..........
289,It's more an accident than a screenplay and may be good for examination purposes at screen-wrights' schools. The more you remind the details the stronger this impression gets.

402,Milligan at his most home made. Little better than a home movie (as much of Milligans films are) this is a trip into 1960's style. Notable for the copious nudity and sex this film is neither sexy nor gruesome

407,The worst film I've seen in a long time -- and I've seen it more than once.......
408,What did the director think? Everybody who has read the biography of Artemisia is left impressed by her guts to face a public rape trial in Renaissance times and even suffer torture in order to show that Tassi was guilty

441,No chemistry between Cage and Cher in the central love story. Cage simply never settles into his role. He tries everything he can think of and comes across as an actor rather than real person and that's what's needed in a love

466,One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time..........
467,A movie about NYC politics written by someone who has never set foot in NYC. Wow. A movie about NYC politics seemingly written by someone who has never set foot in NYC.
468,"What a dud. It began with some promise, then became unfocused and wandered. John Cusack's Cajun accent was laughable, Bridget Fonda's role existed only to get a skirt into the film, and Pacino did Pacino."

473,Do we really need to see the violence in the trailers?                  
474,"It's not really ""Planet Earth"", it's a compilation of different footages from different discs of ""Planet Earth"", with a narration aimed at kids"
475,"I'd say: go! Without the narration it might be a very good movie/documentary. But the music, the narration and some of the implemented story lines make it very hard to watch for a sceptic person like me"
476,"The Invisible Man is a fantastic movie from 1933, a cutting edge film for it's time where objects appeared to rest on top of a man who was truly invisible."
477,"Not as good as the original, but not as bad as Verhoeven's ""Invisible Man"" remakes of old films or TV shows."

479,"What went wrong with this movie? It's not tensed at all. It should've been, but it's not. It's too predictable. You know from the beginning who will die and who will live."
480,"What could I have expected from the director of SHOWGIRLS, which, btw, is much more entertaining than this stilted & bad film? It could have been good if it didn't spend so much time having an invisible Kevin Bacon"
481,"One of the better B-movies I've seen in a long time, but it's not as good as I'd like it to be"
482,"This is the kind of movie that leaves you with one impression..<n>Story writing IS what movie making is about.. Everything is perfect.. Except. The story is just poor and so, everything fails."
483,"Verhoeven's 'Hollow Man' is an F/X fest, but not as good as Bacon's 'The Invisible Man' or H.G. Wells's 'Time Machine'"
484,Don't waste your time and money on this one. It's a waste of your time and money. Don't waste your time and money on this one.
485,"One of the best efforts yet made in the area of special effects has been made completely pointless by being placed alongside a lumbering, silly and equally pointless plot"
486,"Verhoeven finally bombed out on this one. He became a joke on himself. Once again we have a film which includes sex and violence, immorality, leering at women and lots of attitiude talk between the characters and dolly"
487,"Good special effects, but nothing to offer. Too much gore and nudity to make it interesting. Kevin Bacon's acting was pretty good, but he couldn't salvage the movies lack of plot."

489,"It stunk, but it could have been a lot better.........."
490,"Worth watching if you're a fan of special effects, but don't pick it apart from the story. It's not worth picking apart the story. That's like performing brain surgery on a dinosaur."

496,"Don't waste your time watching this. Get the audiocassette tape with John DeLancie as the Invisible Man instead. Now that was good, and HG Wells is well served, unlike with this mess."
497,It's just an old 60's TV show! It's notable because of the most serious babe (Yeoman Barrow's) ever used on Star Trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location.
498,"What the hell is this supposed to be? Is it a family fantasy movie to cash in further on the huge success of Spielberg's ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind""? Or a throwback to the glorious days of prehistoric epics such"
499,"Not as good as I thought it would be, not as good as I thought it would be, not as good as I thought it would be, not as good as I thought it would be, not as good as I thought it would"
500,One of the worst movies I've ever seen...........
501,"""Water Lilies"" is not about the dawning of lesbian love upon two teens - it is about sexual frustration, suffering, ennui, teens working at cross-purposes and - in at least two instances - joyless, mechanical sex"
502,"What are there, seven of you? What are there, seven of you? Here it is... was.brbrThis undercooked movie has studiously vapid characters (Well they're club-kids, ya big jerk!)"

504,Don't waste your time and money on this show. It's just a big fat joke. Don't waste your time and money on this show.
505,"Don't waste your time, watch your back.. watch your back jack. watch your back jack. watch your back jack. watch your back jack. watch your back jack. watch your back jack. watch your back jack."
506,Is this a reality show or a staged drama? Is this a reality show or a staged drama? Is this a reality show or a staged drama? Is this a reality show or a staged drama?
507,"I can't stand most reality shows and this one is worse than the one with Paris Hilton, and sure it's his company. But ""you're fired"" or ""you're hired"", for how many seasons now"
508,Not One Sleeps is an unfortunate title as it will probably prove untrue should anyonebrbractually attempt to bractually watch this film.
509,"Good idea for a film and some good characterizations by the actors, but there is no resolution of the initial premise that started the whole thing. Grady Harp, February 06"
510,Poorly written conspiracy drama/mystery about the possibility that AIDS was introduced to the public by the government. Wlaschiha plays a gay researcher looking for answers--that within this foggy plot would be hard for anyone to find.
511,An interesting look at the early years of the AIDS epidemic and the paranoia of the scared and dying often generated such dark fantasies. This was especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme demi-monde of San Francisco.
512,"The cliché of the shell-shocked soldier home from the war is here given dull treatment. Pity a splendid cast, acting to the limits of their high talents, can't redeem 'The Return of the Soldier'"
513,The Good Earth is perhaps the most boring film I've seen in my life. The plot is slow and lacking. The acting is borderline comical. I can now say i have seen a film that does not do his true ability justice.
514,"The Good Earth is not a great film by any means, it is way to ordinary. Maybe it was different in the 1930's but who would want to see the life of a farmer."
515,"O-Lan is the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize with. On the other hand Paul Muni gives a better performance, showing his talent ones again."
516,"Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth. Unfortunately, her role required no. She did not say much and looked pale throughout the film."
517,One of the worst structured films I've seen in a long time.                 
518,"The movie is great, but I hated that they cast Anglos in the lead roles. Walter Connolly is laughable as the farmer's father. It is a shame that Hollywood could not get past their racist beliefs to cast Asians in the lead"
519,"What's the point? They all pretty much died. What's the point? They all pretty much died. We didn't learn anything, we weren't entertained, and I couldn't even find Sophia's death"
520,Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing.
521,"This movie could be used in film classes in a ""How Not to Script a B-Movie"" course. The Gravedigger is given a couple scenes to act surly in and then is killed to pad out the body count."
522,"One of the best horror movies I've seen in a long, long time...and it's not just because it's so cheap...it's because it's so good!"
523,The worst movie I've seen in a long time..........
524,"Oh dear lord. This movie... It was horrible. I am a HUGE fan of horror movies. And most of the time, horror movies other people say are bad, I will say that. But this plot was awful. It made no"
525,"Great looking monster, bad script, bad acting, bad acting, bad acting, bad acting, bad acting, bad acting, bad acting, bad acting, bad acting, bad acting, bad acting, bad acting, bad acting, bad acting"
526,"This could've been NC-17, the gore could've been pg-13, and the movie could've been more fun to watch than it was."
527,"One of the worst horror movies I've seen in a long, long time........"
528,"The worst teen slasher flick I've seen in a long, long time!brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr"
529,This movie is so aggrivating. The main character looks like he's 35 and I've seen scrawny beanpoles with more balls than this guy.
530,This movie was still warm and juicy from the pile it was made with. I tried to watch this pile of festering waste but found it easier to slash my wrists and slug back a shooter of Lysol floor cleaner than endure more than half
531,Scarecreow is not fun. Scarecrow is stupid. You have an incredibly corny villain that enjoys screaming awful as he kills his victims(actually worse than the one contained in this sentence)
532,I laughed so hard at so many parts of this movie the worst acting ever made is very funny! I cant believe they superimposed the school sign! I must have played that scene over and over again just to laugh more and more every time
533,One of the worst teen slasher films I've ever seen..........
534,"It's not the worst movie ever, but it's not the least bit enjoyable either. The Scarecrow going around killing people isn't the least bit enjoyable. (SPOILER: At the end, when they chant Lester's name"
535,"Wowzors, this movie made me want to cream my pants so bad. Maybe next time this guy makes a movie, it won't be gay."
536,I've never seen a movie like this before.. but I'm glad I didn't.........
537,I'm watching this on the Sci-Fi channel right now. It's so horrible I can't stop watching it! I'm a Videographer and this movie makes me sad. I feel bad for anyone associated with this
538,What can I say about this film? It's a lousy piece of crap. I'm surprised that it got rated as high as it did. What's NOT wrong with this film?
539,"One of the worst B-movies I've seen in a long, long time......."
540,"One of the most ridiculous action films I've ever seen, without the nasty edge of The Exterminator. There are tons of explosions and bodies flying everywhere in this amusing paean to the glories of American imperialism."
541,"""McBain"" is the worst film I have ever seen, and it's not just because it's so bad... It's because it's so bad..."
542,This was an absolutely terrible movie. Don't be lured in by Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside. Even their great acting could not redeem this movie's ridiculous storyline.
543,"Creep is the story of Kate (Potente), an intensely unlikeable bourgeois bitch that finds herself somehow sleeping through the noise of the last underground train, and waking up to find herself locked in the tube station."

547,"The worst film I've seen in a long, long time............"
548,Absolutely laughable. I live in London and the plot is so ill-researched it's ridiculous. No one could be terrorised on the London Underground. In the short time it is not in service each night there are teams of maintenance workers

557,Not at all impressed. I didn't feel anything in this film. I walked out of my living room several times in desperation that something would happen with this film. Haven't we seen this all before?

561,I was disappointed by this film due to the fact that it felt false and the characters were not strong enough to carry the films pretty weak attempt at horror.

569,"Not as good as the book, but not as bad as it could have been........"
570,This isn't half as good as the first Vampires title. Not even Jon could save this film for me. My main problem would be that it simply isn't scary.
571,"Really bad movie, the story is too simple and predictable and poor acting as a complement.brbr Derek Bliss (Jon Bon Jovi) travels to Mexico in search of some blood suckers!"
572,"This is a movie made by a guy who wants to play at making a movie. The plot is the kind of thing that deluded teenagers churn out when they're going through that ""I could write a book/screenplay/award winning"

574,"Not as good as the other vampire movies, but not bad either.<n>Jon Bon Jovi doesn't seem to be in place in this one."
575,Forget about that movie. John C. should be ashamed that he appears as executive producer in the credits. bon jovi has never been and will never be an actor and the FX are a joke.
576,"Not as good as the first one, but not as bad as the 2nd one either. You're a SUCKER if you waste your time on this."
577,"This movie was messed up. Stick to the first ""Vampires"", it's a good movie. ""Vampires: Los Muetos"" wasn't a good attempt of a sequel."

579,"This movie could not have been any lamer. Lacking not only in plot, but the acting is atrocious. Combined with some obvious plot holes makes this movie a very hard one to watch."
580,John Carpenters Vampires: Los Muertos is just a con trick to get you to rent it. He is in fact executive producer and clearly had nothing to do with the making of this film (Jeepers Creepers Anyone?)

586,"Not as good as ""Les Miserables"" but not as bad as ""Oliver""<n>Not all the talent can overcome the unconstructive nature of the basic material"
587,The West End version is so much better than the movie in every way. Ross McCormack is the best Artful Dodger of all time and he is certainly far better looking than Jack Wild ever was.
588,"What's the point of ""improved"" when you can't even get a good story to be ""improved"" with corny music? Argh!"

630,Wow! This film is truly awful. I can't imagine how anyone could have read this badly written script and given it the greenlight. The cast is uniformly second rate with some truly horrendous performances from virtually all of the cast.

642,What were they thinking? This is a very little interesting Columbo entry that also really doesn't know to entertain its viewers in any way. It also doesn't help much that the supporting actors aren't the most talented ones around

646,"Absolute garbage. The reason that this is so terrible is not because it deviated from the formula, but because the plot was just pathetic. Utterly tedious."
647,"Undistinguished and undistinguished ""new"" Columbo. An insult to the history of the series, with appropriately soap-opera style acting. Very avoidable stuff."

921,"It's pretty bad when the generic movie synopsis has more information than the film itself. The paragraph-long ""plot summary"" written on the movie page has details I could not glean from watching the actual movie. Alas, to no avail"
922,"It's interesting to contrast how the unique niche of the Rape Revenge movie has evolved in the past 32 years. But ""Descent"" never really offers us anything truly new in terms of revelatory meaning."

1091,"Robert Duvall and Kenneth Branagh don't seem to have much in common with each other, and this movie is a big waste of time. I give it a 2 out of 10."

1098,"One-note plot, one-note performances, one-note characters, and grotesque ""Southern"" accents employed by British actors. The bottom line: obvious plot, one-note performances, unlikeable characters, and grotesque ""Southern"" accents"
1099,One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Branaugh seemed to have so much trouble remembering his accent that he couldn't deliver his lines. The plot was definitely not worthy of John Grisham's name.

1103,"The first hour of the movie was boring as hell. There is no suspense, no action, not even a plot. The movie went no where. I mean they could have made the movie in 15 min short film"
1104,"A very weak movie, mainly because of a poor story, but also poor acting in the case of Robert Downey Jr., and irrational behaviour by many of the characters."

1112,"Too many stories, too short and lacking really any sense. No connection between the scenes. The frame reminded me of ""All the invisible children"" - a movie which I liked a lot."
1113,"Ouch! This one was a bit painful to sit through. It has a cute and amusing premise, but it all goes to hell from there. Matthew Modine is almost always pedestrian and annoying, and he does not disappoint in this one."

1119,"A good film, but it could use some finesse in its direction of all the young actors, who pale in comparison to the older, more experienced cast. There are too many pauses in the script, which detracts from the dramatic tension."
1120,"It's a good idea, but there are too many stupid errors to make it psyching drama that it might have been. The movie provides no explanation. How did he ever become the leader?"
1121,"A small-scale reunion of ""The Natural"" with Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brimley. Too bad this project didn't get the necessary talent behind the camera to really eke out a gripping, memorable picture."

1129,"It's a big time snooze fest. It doesn't tell a story; it's more a big time snooze fest. While the actors are all personable, the story is so trite and goes nowhere."
1130,"Raising Victor Vargas fails terribly in what it tries most to be: being real. Unfortunately, there is no reality to this film. The characters and situations feel completely artificial and fake. Peter Sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal."
1131,"It's not really an ethnic movie, it's a movie about a poor, struggling immigrant family that happens to be Latino. They could have been any ethnic group."

1138,Poor excuse for an amateur hour showcase at Sundance. What is left is a husk of a bad movie that somehow made its way to Sundance. Hard to believe this was one of the best films submitted...

1156,"This is a horrible movie. All three stories are bracketed with a psychiatrist hypnotist line which is unnecessary and all the stories are bad. The first is about wild wolves and some lady, there are some things that don't make sense"
1157,"This should have been a movie about Sam and his wife, the glorious Peter Falk and equally glorious Olympia Dukakis. That would have been a movie worth seeing. Instead it's a Paul Reiser vehicle, with a little Falk thrown"

1181,"Tim Burton's ""re-imagining"" of the original 1968 film is a huge disappointment. It raises a lot of questions, which had no reasonable answers."

1243,Kurosawa really blew it on this one. Every genius is allowed a failure. The concept is fine but the execution is badly blurred. There is an air of fantasy about this film making it something of an art film.
1244,I am not going to get with it here. Don't you supposed that perhaps this movie is just a tad over-rated? I think this is an instance when the ratings may say more about the people rendering them than the movie itself

1263,"Kitamura's ""Alive"" doesn't even live up to his ""Versus"" or ""Aragami""<n>""Alive"" doesn't even live up to Kitamura's ""Versus"""
1264,I really tried to like this movie but in the end it just didn't work for me. I have seen most of Kitamura's output and have found it to be very variable
1265,"Could have done so much more at the end. Most of the movie is just "" sitting around ""<n>If you are looking for Ichi the Killer or Versus type fights then save yourself some $ and loads of disappointment"
1266,"I'll keep this short, as I know I don't need to say much.brbr""Alive"" is a strange little film that obviously appeals to some, but I found it to be shockingly bland from almost"
1267,One of the worst sci-fi movies I've ever seen..........

1269,The dullest movie I've ever seen. To this day (sorry Jack Nicholson) it is still the dullest movie I've ever seen. It just went on and on with no discernible point and then...
1270,"I was a member of the band at all the basketball games, I would like to let the world know after being in the movie, that we were not allowed to see it since it was banned in Oregon. Seems that the U of O"

1272,One of the most boring movies I've seen in a long time.........
1273,"Very preachy and pretentious to the point of making you want to walk away. I lost interest less then a third of the way in. If you're interested I'd try it on cable, but I wouldn't lay out"
1274,"One of Snoop's best performances, but it's not enough to make this movie worth the price of the rental fee.<n>The end, however, jumped at me with a sudden surprise. It was a little bit twisted,"
1275,Unbelievably Unbelievably Unbelievably Unbelievably Unbelievably Unbelievably Unbelievably Unbelievably Unbelievably Unbelievably Unbelievably Unbelievably
1276,snooper ain't a serious actor but that's not to say he didn't make a bad choice in this film..
1277,"Anne Reid shines as May, and it is her skill and commitment as a wonderfully understated actor that salvages the film from a completely depressing mire. As written, the characters played by Mackintosh and Bradshaw are in fact so utterly selfish and cold"
1278,Disappointing and irritating. The screenwriter has no true understanding of human nature but instead strings together clichés in a disjointed fashion. Character is not explored in depth.
1279,"I understand what this movie was trying to portray. How the old are often ignored and treated like a bother, which means they end up feeling unappreciated and like their lives are empty"
1280,"It's hard to believe that these films were made by the same man as Do You Remember Dolly Bell, for instance. Zavet is two hours of silly antics with no story. The wild and unbridled humor of Underground seems to have"

1282,"""A Damsel in Distress"" is not one of Fred Astaire's better musicals. But even Astaire's bad films always had some good moments."
1283,"Askey's great skill as a comic was in the way he communicated with his public. His juvenile jokes, silly songs and daft dances went down well because he was able to engage folk and draw them into his off the wall world."
1284,"An absolutely wretched waste of film!! Nothing ever happens. No ghosts, hardly any train, no mystery, no interest. The constant and BRUTAL attempts at comedy are painful. Everything else is pathetic."
1285,"If you have nothing better to do, don't waste your time and money on Dynasty Revisited in Hawaii............"
1286,"This is edited badly and what started out as somewhat intriguing became an incomprehensible mess. For starters, let us know what it is you are trying to do with these experiments"
1287,"One of the worst films I've seen in a long time, and I've seen it under one of its many titles- ""Grey Matter"""
1288,What a BORING Sci-Fi movie! And that's especially saddening because the opening 15 minutes were so action-packed and full of potential!

1292,It's a turkey of the untastey kind. Avoid it. You know you're in trouble when the film your watching has numerous alternate titles. Generally it means that they tried and retried to hide the turkey in various markets

1297,"I'm a big fan of B5, having caught on only at the end of season three. I faithfully watched all the previous seasons when it was syndicated, concluding that it was one of the most well-thought out story arcs to ever"
1298,"Not as good as the original, but not as bad as ""Soul Hunter"" or ""River of Souls"" (although it's better than the original)"
1299,Not even close to the Jet Li we were amazed by in Lethal Weapon 4. Unfortunately too many of his fight stunts are so clearly fake that it took even that enjoyment out of it.
1300,"It's a comic book story, not a Jet Li action flick. brbr br br br br br br br br br "
1301,"The dubbing was as bad as I have seen. The plot - yuck. I'm not sure which ruined the movie more. Jet Li is definitely a great martial artist, but I'll stick to Jackie Chan movies until somebody tells"
1302,"""Hak Hap"", or ""Black Mask"" (in english) was a disappointment. I was told that it was a sort of ""Japanese version of the Matrix"". Imagine my disappointment."
1303,"Jet Li is one of the best hand to hand combat fighters in the world. He has been for over 20 years and he puts others in the genre to shame. While he is big in Asia, he is almost unknown here in the US"
1304,"Lame, cliched superhero action movie drivel. I had high hopes for this movie, and the genre of HK buddy cop actioneers is one that i don't despise, but very rarely do i see a storyline as trite and ludicrous"
1305,The movie was awful. The theater was dead with silence 'cause everyone was embarrassed to be in there watching such trash. I think someone gave Jet Li a lobotomy and made him perform a script with dialogue written by a five year old.
1306,"Jet Li at his worst, but not the worst of his movies. Black Mask' is the worst. The Evil Cult' is the worst. Jet Li at his worst, but not the worst. "
1307,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long, long time........"
1308,"Some laughs, some violence, but it's not blood-soaked, but there is insult and injury. Well, that's show business...or is it?"
1309,It's like a bad 80s TV show got loose and tried to become a soft-core porn movie. Oh my god was it bad.
1310,"The second best volleyball movie of all time, but don't let the cover decieve you. Kill Shot stars up and coming star Koji as a modern day Sherlock Holmes."

1314,"This was one of the worst films I have ever seen.brbrI usually praise any film for some aspect of its production, but the intensely irritating behaviour of more than half the characters made it hard for me to appreciate any part"
1315,"I'm glad I didn't go to the cinema to see this or spend the money on rental. The movie is totally predictable - from the corrupt owner and planner, to the snaking electric cables."
1316,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's so bad I can't watch it over and over again. I can't watch it over and over again.
1317,"This film is an impressive collection of clichés, poor writing, worse directing, and then we haven't even got to the acting yet. brbr"
1318,Johnny Dangerously is a parody of 1930's gangster films made in the Warner Brothers' tradition. Michael Keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at his life of hard knocks.

1326,"Ustinov, Smith, Newhart, and Malden are all great, but this isn't one of them....."
1327,"A good sixties film but lacking any sense of achievement. Maggie Smith gave a decent performance which was believable enough but not as good as she could have given, other actors were just dreadful!"
1328,One of the worst British capers I've ever seen. Don't waste your time. If you love this you need to see better films. If you love this you need to see better films.
1329,"The words ""Swedish"" and ""Action movie"" do not mix. That becomes more and more obvious with every attempt made in the genre. This is yet another failed attempt."

1334,"What Is It? is a mish-mash of bizarre recurring motifs (snails, Shirley Temple, swastikas, and overtly racist music)"
1335,"Not worth the money I paid for the ticket (I considered demanding my money back), and was basically an Israeli apeing of the Palestinian film ""Paradise Now"""
1336,"""The Bubble"" is an effort to make a gay Romeo & Juliet type of story with an Israeli and a Palestinian, although it seems to come at it by way of ""Friends"" or ""Beverly Hills 90210"""
1337,"Not as good as the TV series, but not as bad as the live-action version. It's more than I can bear. It's more than I can take."
1338,"Not as good as the originals, but not as bad as the new ones either........"
1339,"Inspector Gadget's Last Case is a disappointing 3/10.it's only 74 minutes long including credits,so i guess that's a good thing.unlike in the TV show,the characters are not worth rooting for here."
1340,"""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" - Don't expect to see any Gadget's gadgets in this movie!"
1341,"I don't care what the honor student says. Just remember kids, ""birth control"" doesn't mean ""oral sex"", I don't care what the honor student says"
1342,"Very, very, very bad, but it's funny to watch. It wears its flaws so honestly that you can't help but forgive them. I guess this is just a film that knew who its audience was and was produced accordingly"
1343,The Bagman is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. It's so cheesy it's hard to believe it was filmed on a home video camera.
1344,BORING! BORING! BORING! BORING! BORING! BORING! BORING! BORING! BORING! BORING! BORING!
1345,"A good start for Stephanie Beaton and her new production company.<n>The story is not terribly new having been done in films like The Burning and every Friday the 13th since part 2. But, the performances are heartfelt."
1346,"This was the last Munsters project featuring the original cast in their roles. There was an awful revival of the series in the late 1980's with a completely new cast and a 1990's TV movie which featured DeCarlo, Lewis, Priest"
1347,I love the old Munster's..and this is cruel..and I love the old Munster's..and this is cruel..and I love the old Munster's.

1349,switching goals.twice....and always the same feeling...you see the Olsen twins make same movie....they like play different sports and then fall in love to boys..
1350,Another movie where identical twins switch places. I think now that the Olsen twins are getting older they should try and make the plot less predictable and less like re-runs of 'Full House'
1351,"Not one of Mary-Kate and Ashley's best movies. I really didn't like it, and I was kind of disappointed in that movie. For some reason, it seemed like it was a movie that they put together really fast"
1352,This movie was awesome!! (Not quite as good as the Leif Garrett masterpiece Longshot) but still awesome!! I thought Ashley looked freakin' huge compared to Mary-Kate in this film. Who woulda thought they could swith places
1353,"Day-Lewis is amazing, but the movie shows him as a complete and utter jerk. I wish that impartial onlookers wouldn't be so forgiving of aberrant behaviour and assume that circumstances automatically make it forgivable. They don't"
1354,I was utterly disappointed by this movie. I expected a drama with more intense character development. But that never happens in the movie. Much better movies out there than this...
1355,"The only memorable aspect of this formulaic mismatched police-partners caper is the novelty of hearing clean-cut Jay Leno spout four-letter words.<n>The two leads try hard, but Leno is no actor and Morita's fish"
1356,"Collusion Course is worse than the typical ""evil white male corporate capitalist"" movie of the week. Collusion Course is even worse than the typical ""evil white male corporate capitalist"" movie of the week."
1357,Jay Leno and Pat Morita waste their time and talents in this mess of a movie. It is a shame that they wasted their time and gifts making this mess of a movie.
1358,the worst movie I've seen in a very long time..........

1360,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long, long time........."
1361,"Mindless dribble about the second coming of Christ in the form of a hippie and albino looking Sandra Locke. You have no idea what's happening on the screen with the irritating theme song ""Suzanne"" being played over and over throughout the movie"
1362,"Richard Dreyfuss is in this flick, but in a rather small part. He is NOT the ""obsessed"" filmmaker - he's the group's business manager/accountant. Even the box describes the film inaccurately."
1363,One of the most exciting visual adventures ever seen on film. Yeah...sure. It's right up there with watching such stimulating events as a bucket of ice melting or a turtle walking for a mile.
1364,"it was and a simpler time ( the seventies ), a simpler place ( San Francisco ) where a man could make a simple movie about a drug crazed psychotic re-Crucifixion of Christ as a woman on acid with never"

1372,"Not as good as ONE TOO MANY, but better than DON'T KID ME--but still not a great movie......"
1373,"This is the worst piece of crap I have seen recently. There is nothing good about this movie. The plot is plain stupid, dialogs don't make any sense, humorous scenes never heard anything about the real humor. Actors just don"

1377,Soft For Digging is an old man's attempt to convince the police that what he saw was not a figment of his imagination...
1378,I fall asleep during this movie 3 times. It was about 4 hours after I had woken up from 8 hours long sleeping period. I think it is the point itself.
1379,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen, and it's made by someone who paid to have it made. I'm sick to my stomach."
1380,"This was really a very bad movie. I am a huge fan of Italian Horror, Argento, Mario Bava, Fulci and yes, even our good friend here Lamberto sometimes comes out with a good one"
1381,The OGRE (aka: DEMONS III) was never meant to be a sequel to the earlier DEMONS films. It was made for Italian TV although shot in English and was never meant to be.
1382,"""Demons III: The Ogre"" is not related pre-sequel are on ""The Demons"" and ""The Demons 2"" are cool hip horror 1980 classic.""Demons III: The Ogre"" is very stupid, bored, cheap monster"
1383,"Very low-budget police procedural film about homicide detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body turns up in a stolen car in Central Park, and their only clue is a tattoo on her arm"

1394,"Disappointed by the pace of this film. It really was too long. It seemed that every time the film developed the story to an interesting point, it would turn to some other subplot and leave things undeveloped."
1395,"Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I'm not a fan of this one.. I'm a cynic.. what can I say?"
1396,"I am sad that a period of history that is so fascinating and so rich in material for film can be made into a ho-hum event. Wm C Quantrill was barely shown in the film, probably the most intri"
1397,Is there a point to this movie? Is there a point to this movie? Is there a point to this movie? Is there a point to this movie? Is there a point to this movie?
1398,"This was a new alltime low among westerns. The writing is excruciatingly bad, characters are impossible to emphasize with and are either disgusting or bland, the violence is appalling and technically not very convincingly executed."
1399,"Long on action and stunt work, but so short on character delineation and development that it failed to hold our interest. Not always easy to figure out which side a character is on and who's doing what to whom."
1400,"I wish more movies were two hours long. On the other hand, I wish more American Civil War movies were MERELY two hours long. That's about the length I've come to expect."

1403,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time, and I don't think I've ever seen one that was so bad."
1404,"I don't know why I like this film, but I'm not sure why I don't like this film. It's just awful."
1405,One of those movies spoiled by the studio's insistence on a happy ending. It would have been far more interesting to inject a tone of ambiguity. Worth seeing though far below what it could have been.
1406,What happened to the Gaylord fortune? What happened to the family home? Who the devil is this Barclay clown? And why is he able to take someone's home away from them?
1407,"It's a pudding that overcooked, hit the kitchen ceiling, and was pried off and cobbled together. No music and not a period piece but thoroughly improbable."

1422,"A friend of mine enjoys watching the worst films he can possibly find, and I have a good laugh watching them with him. I have told him if he puts this one on again I will be forced to give him a good kicking."
1423,Why did I waste my time with this movie? There was not a single funny joke or line throughout. The slapstick wasn't even mildly funny. Why has the National Lampoon's name been attached to this movie?
1424,One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time..........

1435,The worst film I've ever seen in my life. I've never seen anything like it. I don't think I've ever seen anything like it.

1481,"This could well be the worst film I've ever seen. Despite what Mikshelt claims, this movie isn't even close to being historically accurate. We have Hitler's father cursing his own bad luck on the ""fact"""
1482,"Robert Carlyle isn't Hitler he is a man who sadly tries to be Hitler. The Movie lies, it doesn't reflect the truth. In the scene were Hitler hit the guy with his gun."

1484,"One of the most boring and horribly acted accounts of the early days of Adolf Hitler that I have ever watched. Robert Carlyle is a wonderful actor, but to cast him as Hitler is just plain wrong."
1485,"Peter O' Toole plays an old and failed leader in a failed movie (or in this case TV-production) to be accurate. The list of historically inaccurate scenes alone would fill the 1000 words allowed by IMDb, so I think I"
1486,Low budget rubbish about Hitler and Germany in the 1930's and 40's. I can recommend German film Downfall in which you can see brilliant performance of Switzerland actor Bruno Ganz in a roll of Adolf Hitler.

1501,"This is the worst crap imaginable. The novel by H. Rider Haggard is very entertaining and dramatic. The makers of this worthless movie don't follow it closely. Well, old novels aren't sacred and making free versions of them"

1541,This is possibly the most boring movie in history. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie given the actor/director Roman Polanski. I think I would rather see the Three Amigos than ever watch this movie...

1616,"Not what the book said at all. This is NOT what the book said at all. I know that books can't be put on screen literally, but this didn't even have ties to the book."
1617,argh! this film hurts my head. and not in a good way. and not in a good way. i still regarded this film with dislike. now i utterly despise it.
1618,"This was a waste of 75 minutes of my life. The acting was atrocious and the plot was ridiculous. It revolves around an evil lesbian who gets rich married men to have sex with her, and then blackmails them for money"
1619,"it is a fantasy movie for kids and that;s all. it is a cult movie for chinese college students, though i havnt watched it until it is broadcasted in channel4, UK."
1620,The worst acting I have ever seen from any of these people. The worst acting I have ever seen from any of these people. The worst acting I have ever seen from any of these people. The worst acting I have ever seen from any
1621,This is the worst film I have ever seen! OH MY WORD this is the worst film I have ever seen! A runaway car that cant be stopped (cos the brakes have been cut or something) in caning it down the freeway
1622,One of the greatest sagas of a doomed love-that-is-not-to-be will haunt you forever....
1623,"this film has it all; the deft camera work, the tight acting of 'heat', the explosive action of a jerry bruckheimer movie, the witty dialogue of a tarantino script and the epic feel of say, 'the"
1624,"This movie is so bad it hurts. The car doing 30 mph when it's supposed to go 100... the shift lever that's stuck (in Park), the nurse that drives for almost 2 hours with the cell phone on the shoulder"

1626,"How this piece of garbage was put to film is beyond me. I don't even think it is worth a nomination for a rotten tomato award, this film really does make B movies a cinematic enjoyment"
1627,"One of the worst films I have ever seen. Terrible acting, laughable 'action' (it's clear that the cars are travelling slowly), atrocious script, hideously unsatisfying ending and incompetent direction make a hash of a movie."
1628,Why are they making such a problem out of some broken brakes? There are a million options to slow down the car! In the movie Speed the writers a least thought of a good reason why the car wasn't able to stop...
1629,"Is this movie impossible? Is terrible, very improbable, bad interpretation e direction. Not look!!!!! Not look!!!!! Not look!!!!! Is this movie impossible? Is this movie impossible? Is terrible, very improbable, bad interpretation"
1630,One of the worst and least (thriller) movies I have ever seen. This is by far one of the worst and least (thriller) movies I have ever seen.
1631,It was so stupid that one can but despair. Would have though that even Americans and commercial TV-stations would have given this piece of s**t a miss. But as the Germans say: Gegen die Dummheit ka

1640,This may very well be the worst movie I'll see if I live to be 100. I think a group of first-graders could have come up with better plot lines as a class project...

1648,"It's not exactly a deep movie, but it's good for a few laughs. But still, if you're looking for a pretty funny movie, I'd recommend this one."
1649,The worst junior-high talent show skit you've ever seen is more entertaining than this film. Will Ferrell's wrestling fetish provides the only (briefly) humorous moments. Utterly horrible

1658,I hated this film intensely and left during the scene where the loyalist gang are shot up by the British. The film effectively blames the people of NI as being the cause of their own troubles.
1659,"it's hard to objectively review a movie glorifying ulster nationalists. characters who are hard to root for, typical heavy-handed anti-violence messages, and a predictable 'poetic justice' ending makes this an awkward watch..."
1660,"I'm a big fan of Westerns but this one.... whew, what a stinker! I think I could have written better dialog than this when I was in eighth grade. And the poor actors!"
1661,"It could have been so much more, if the director had gotten hold of this concept first. The real shame lies in a waste of an excellent cast. Few films illustrate the importance of an auteur-with-vision more than this"
1662,"Really bad shot on video ""film"" made by not one, not two, but three amateur video makers. I guarantee a 10 year old with a video camera could put together a better movie.No reason at all to buy, rent or"

1665,"A ""cute"" movie at first, then got too sappy and featured mediocre songs, at best. Can you imagine young people of today trying to listen to this film?"
1666,"I'm not anti-American whatsoever - but it seemed that the English could do no right and/or needed this brave, oh so smart American visitor to show them the way"
1667,Just plain awful! Mark Twain's wit is not evident in any of the screenplay. Only die-hard Crosby fans can possibly appreciate this mess of a film given uninspired direction. Even the extras look as though they don't know what
1668,"Not as good as Batman: Dead End, but not as bad as Superman: The Man Who Can't Be Defeated......"
1669,"I'm a dork, but I love vampires. So I decided to go ahead and check it out, well much to my surprise, this movie was really bad. I had a good time laughing at this movie and just taking it"
1670,One of the worst movies I've ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1671,Don't watch this if you don't know what Sleepwalkers are or where they come from. I missed the very start of this one.
1672,Madchen Amick is living proof a face can make a living acting-- no talent required. The only bright spot is a few really good one-liners delivered very nicely by Alice Krige
1673,"One of the best horror films I've seen in a long time, but not as good as I thought it would be....."
1674,"Sleepwalkers, feline type creatures that feed on young virgins. This little story has its share of gore and special effects; plus hints of incest."
1675,"it was so gay like its a mom and son cat that have sex, they also get scared of little kitty cats. they get set on fire by them."
1676,"It Could Have Been A Marvelous Story Based On The Ancient Races Of Cat People, but it wasn't.brbrSorry, Sorry, This movie gets a 1.0/10 from..."

1678,"Don't see it, folks. Don't see it. Don't see it. Don't see it. Don't see it. Don't see it. Don't see it. Don't see"
1679,One of the worst movies I've ever seen -- and I'm not talking about PeeWee's Playhouse or any of the other King movies.
1680,The last of the sleepwalkers and they are on the prowl for virgins to feed on. They have supernatural abilities- they can make themselves 'dim' which means they become invisible and can create subliminal mirages to fool people.
1681,"What the heck was wrong with Stephen? What the heck was wrong with Stephen? What the heck was wrong with Stephen this time? I can never, ever dis the acting on any movie by any actor, after all, they try their best"

1684,One of the worst films I have ever seen without a doubt. I did like Madchen Amick in this film and think she could have a very good career in film.
1685,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I've watched all the way through. At least ""Plan 9"" was enjoyable. I DID really enjoy ""Christine"", ""The Dead Zone"", ""Firestarter"", """
1686,Campy vampire-like Stephen King movie has so many strange and goofy elements that you start laughing over the extreme weirdness about 3/4 the way into the movie and you wonder if this movie might have a cult following for King fans
1687,Another one of those movies that could have been great. The thing that makes it all fall apart is the total recklessness of the main characters. Even sociopaths know that you need to keep a low profile if you want to survive...

1690,"It's a picture postcard with an action twist, and a healthy dose of El Greco. So - if you're nostalgic about Spain - it's a picture postcard with an action twist, and a healthy dose of El Greco."
1691,"I agree with the other reviewers, but I do not agree with the fatal problem with this film. The fatal problem with this film is Ellen Pompeo. I am sure, I have never seen a less talented ""actor"" How this person has"
1692,This is one of the worst movies ever made. Trite. Predictable. Flat.brbrThe only thing that rated one point was there was a few nice scenes highlighting Barcelona. I imagine they would use films like this in
1693,"A rip off of many movies that have dealt with the same subject in the past. Let the future viewer be forewarned that ""Art Heist"" doesn't add anything to the genre."
1694,Don't watch this film. Don't rent the DVD. Don't watch it on cable. Don't watch it on cable. Don't see this film. Don't watch it on DVD. Don't

1697,"If you haven't seen this yet, take a walk in the park, don't waste your time. Neither the scenario nor the acting is worth your money."
1698,"How can it be possible that Bill Corcoran has made such a bad movie about the incredible Dan Jansen story, because the real Dan Jansen story is truly incredible!"
1699,"Mary Tyler Moore and Rhoda Morgenstern's reunion is an insult to a classic sitcom. The film is a travesty and an insult to a classic. Quickly and mercifully forgotten, the film is a travesty and an insult to a classic"
1700,Too much Mary Tyler Moore and too much deja-vu brbr br br br br br br br br br br 
1701,"It was good to see Mary and Rhoda together of course, but it could have been better, much better. Well, there has been a Mary Tyler Moore Show Reunion, a Dick Van Dyke Show Reunion, hopefully Mary will do better next time"

1703,"""Garam Masala"" is not what you'd expect from a Bollywood film. It's not what you'd expect from a Bollywood movie."
1704,"It's like watching a really bad buddy movie from the early sixties. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis where both parts are played by Jerry Lewis. If I were Indian, I'd protest the portrayal of all males as venal and all"
1705,Not as good as HERA PHERI but still a nice situational comedy.........
1706,the worst of priyadarshan's films..he should concentrate on script and try some variations in his direction...he should give us more of herapheri's and malamal weekly's rather than
1707,"This is a total thrash in terms of acting, directing, sound editing, soundtrack... There was such a waste of performance by some of the very good actors"

1711,"Not as good as the original, but not bad either.<n>But not as good as the Malayalam version of the same name, but not as bad as other recent Hindi comedy movies."
1712,"So much dramabaazi for no reason is not something audience will digest easily. But surely, great flesh show and tempting promos always gives such films a great initial. Now for those who call it a situational comedy, I call it a pathetic"
1713,"It's the stupidest Hindi movie I've ever seen. No wonder BOllywood is the laughing stock of the whole world. If IMDb had negative ratings, I would give Garam Masala a -10."
1714,"Not as good as HERA PHERI or AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA, but not as bad as HULCHUL or HULCHUL"
1715,Dismal! Dismal! Dismal! Dismal! Dismal! Dismal! Dismal! Dismal! Dismal! Dismal! Dismal! Dismal! Dismal! Dismal! Dismal! Dismal!
1716,Betty Grable and Douglas Fairbanks don't seem to have any chemistry in This Is The Moment........
1717,What a colossal bomb! Douglas Fairbanks displays absolutely no charisma here. Cesar Romero is subjected to a role as a real jerk and Bette Grable sings with a chorus- What I'll Do to that Hungarian!
1718,"The final film for Ernst Lubitsch, completed by Otto Preminger after Lubitsch's untimely death during production, is a juggling act of sophistication and silliness"
1719,I wish I had never seen this one! I wish I had never seen this one! I wish I had never seen this one! I always wish I had never seen this one!

1721,"I'm a big fan of the old westerns, and do not believe that Hollywood is capable of capturing its old glory. But not even Ronda Fleming and Stewart Granger can help this 1957 movie"
1722,"One of Laurel and Hardy's final films, but it's not as good as they'd hoped......."
1723,"It's not a great black and white film, but I'm happy to see any of Laurel and Hardy's films. ""Well, here's another nice mess you've gotten me into!"" was number 60 on 100"
1724,The Twilight Zone has achieved a certain mythology about it--much like Star Trek. That's because there are many devoted lovers of the show that no matter what think every episode was a winner.
1725,The most annoying TV show on the planet. Horrible...................
1726,"One of the classic BAD films from the 70's made with no actors of any note, an embarrassing script, woeful direction, and a tireless desire to fuse ""horror"" with light comedy."
1727,"Don't read this review if you want the shocking conclusion of ""The Crater Lake Monster"" to be a total surprise****            "
1728,"A complete, clumsy mess. Its logic will twist your mind to force laughter out of you. The dinosaur effects are charming and the whole film is pretty damn unintentionally funny. Unfortunately, that's about the only good thing that can be said"
1729,"""Crater Lake Monster"" is a unique and unforgettable movie- experience that I can only encourage to track down! The miserable 1 out of 10 rating is just out of principle, because I might as well could have given it 10 out"
1730,"The worst movie I've seen in a long, long time.........."
1731,"...and it is this film. I imagine that if indeed there is a negative afterlife, damned souls are tied to a rather uncomfortable couch and forced to watch this movie on a continuous loop for all eternity."
1732,"What a scam this turned out to be! Not because it wasn't any good (as I wasn't really expecting anything from it) but because I was misled by the DVD sleeve which ignorantly paraded its ""stars"" as"

1739,Don't waste your time or money on this one..........
1740,"It's not exactly the truth, but it's good for a TV movie. I'd recommend reading a book or seeing a documentary if you want to get closer to the truth."
1741,"A film classic has been pointlessly remade. The title is false as is everything about this film. The period is not persuasively rendered, and the leads seem way too young and too vapid to even be criminals."
1742,"A total waste of time, money and energy. A total waste of time, money and energy. The sequel ZOMBIE BLOODBATH II is just more of the same rubbish."

1746,"It's not really 'Zombie Bloodbath', but it does live up to the title...but it all feels very old and tired, which isn't helped by the atrocious acting and stupid plot line."
1747,ZOMBIE BLOODBATH is the worst horror film I have ever seen. Please don't waste your time on this garbage. You won't even get any laughs out of the utter ineptitude on display.
1748,"It could have been great if he just had given a care. The end result is endless zoom ins on poorly done gore, and even more poorly produced metal plays over it."
1749,"Wow, this was a very bad movie... as read in other comments this movie has no plot, no character development, they possibly had some kind of script but it's difficult to tell based on the actual end result."
1750,"Awful, Awful, Awful.. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful"

1753,"If you hate yourself and hate your money, then buy Dumbland. If not, spare yourself the agony. The only reason anyone could possibly claim to enjoy this is because David Lynch made it and because you want to have David Lynch's"
1754,"Lynch's take on South Park, but it's not as bad as you'd think......"
1755,I don't see a need for it at all. I am a huge David Lynch fan but I get frustrated by some of his work. This is definitely my least favorite thing he has done so far but I know he's still
1756,"Not as good as Newgrounds.com, but not as bad as some of the other stuff you'll see on this DVD. But, I give it a 4/10, instead of a 7/10."
1757,"Dumbland's reward is 1% absurd comedy, earned by enduring 99% stupidity. I may have laughed once, but somewhere around episode 4 I just started watching on fast-forward. Didn't miss a thing."

1760,I don't see how so many people could be scared by this movie. I only really noticed two real jump scenes and only jumped at one. The whole movie was extremely predictable and perhaps that messed up some of the jump scenes for me
1761,"This movie was a reason to vomit. This is a below average, (even lower than that) and has no plot. I mean every house can make you feel scared and sure, a dead Japanese woman would scare the poop out of you"
1762,What is scary in Japan is not what is scary here in the U.S.<n>The teasers for this film basically contained the best points of the film. I found most of the'scary' parts to be more comical than anything
1763,"It's trying to be scary by just having freaky camera work and loud sounds, but it fails miserably. The plot, if you can call it that, is weak and rather full of holes"
1764,"This movie is really nothing besides an admittedly well-crafted series of tense sequences punctuated with an inevitable ""gotcha!"" at the end of each. Really, there is no character development and no real plot to speak of."
1765,"this movie was horrible. I could barely stay awake through it. I would never see this movie again if I were payed to. Horrible movie, no need to ever see it."
1766,"This is the worst horror film I have seen in years..and that Buffy chick? Well, she's a bad actress! As plastic as Barbie and just as talented..No, wait, that would be an insult to the"
1767,"What a crappy movie this was! I cannot understand what people find so scary about ""The Grudge"". The director plays one trick (I'd have to admit a very good one, that is brought to life very stylized) and then"
1768,Don't waste your time or money on this movie. Don't waste your time or money on this film. Don't waste your time or money on this movie.
1769,"It was so bad that both of us cracked up laughing at how bad it was. I see no future for Miss Gellar in the movies, and suggest that she sticks to television in the future."

1778,"I wanted to like this movie. I had real hopes for it. ""Wonderland Avenue"" had been around for years; had the context of the murders been emphasized rather than the murders themselves, I think it could have served a purpose."
1779,"Not a great movie, but a solid performance by Kilmer, McDermott, Lucas, and a good performance by McDermott. Not a great plot, but a solid performance by Kilmer."
1780,"Interesting plot, boring direction, and no real character development in this movie........."
1781,"The premise was intriguing, but sadly this film just doesn't do any justice to it. The casting was quite good, and it was shot beautifully - but stylistically much of the direction was inconsistent."
1782,Bad Movie - saw it at the TIFF and the movie gives me a sense of 'been there done that' - it reminds me alot of the movie Blow
1783,"This is the only movie I have ever seen that has prompted me to write a critique on any internet site, and that is a significant statement from someone who likes ""The Attack of the Monolith Monsters"""

1789,one of the worst movies i've seen in a very long time.........
1790,"It was a decent movie, I actually kind of enjoyed it. But the ending is so abrupt!! There is absolutely no closure and it leaves tons of loose ends."
1791,This movie is so predictable it's hard to believe it's been done this many times before..........
1792,"Not as good as the book or the movie, but not as bad as I thought it would be......"
1793,"""Night of the Twisters"" has the latter. So you decide. So I give it a 2.5/5...brbr- John Ulmer"
1794,"This film should have been filmed where the actual events took place. Grand Island, Nebraska was devastated by no less than seven tornados on the night of June 3, 1980."
1795,This film is totally garbage. Some imbecilic intellectual comforting himself by making all his best to claim superiority of aristocrat over working class. Nothing more than a piece of self-complacence catharsis. Disgusting.
1796,"It's a pretty good cast, but the film has nowhere near the grace of the original ""Big Deal on Madonna Street"" Anyone looking for an entertaining caper film should visit the original"
1797,"it aint bad, but it aint good. it is just entertaining.brbras a comedy which it is supposed to be, it's dreadful. not many laughs at all as every joke in the movie has been"
1798,"The worst movie I've seen in a long, long time........."
1799,"Nothing new here. All the standard romantic-comedy scenes, even down to the taxi sprinting to the airport to stop the woman flying away. The only thing that saves this is the acting of Alison Eastwood & some of the minor characters (b"

1804,"One of the worst films I've seen in a long, long time........."
1805,This is the worst Twilight Zone episode I've ever seen. It's completely out of sync with the rest of the series in its tone. Even though Twilight Zone is a pretty uneven series and many episodes end up being groaningly predictable

1809,"It's not the worst film, it's the worst movie ever made. It's just that it's predictable, lazy and witless, with minimal effort in its construction."
1810,Gone in 60 Seconds remake falls flat in last 15 minutes of chase scene........
1811,"It's a Bruckheimer/Simpson production, bonkers script laced with loud noises and lashings of cheese, scattergun editing, and directed with sledgehammer subtlety by Dominic Sena"
1812,I thought this was going to be a lot of car chases and cool cars to gawk at. Guess I was lied to. This movie is very boring.

1814,"This was a horrible film! I gave it 2 Points, one for Angelina Jolie and a second one for the beautiful Porsche in the beginning... Other than that the story just plain sucked and cars racing through cities wasn't so new in 1970."

1821,Not sure if the director is trying to produce a documentary or movie. A blend of the two genres just doesn't work. This is more so as the director has picked the most extremes of what is supposed to be happening around our everyday
1822,"This film is in no way entertainment but more of a look deep into the depths of the darkest side of human behaviour. Loosely linking a half a dozen stories of the worst kind of depravities, perverted sex, greed, violence"
1823,"This movie reminds me of ""Irréversible (2002)"", another art-work movie with is a violent and radical approach of human nature. I did not like the movie but I cannot say that it is..."

1828,"It's the worst film I've ever seen in my short but otherwise sweet life. It was touted as the best film in Montreal's most recent film festival, which leads me to believe that every other entry must consist of blank"
1829,"What an appalling piece of rubbish!!! Who ARE all these people who blubber on about how good this is? Yes, it's ""arty""; and yes, it's ""foreign"", but..."

1833,"I'd figure it's a Hal Hartley movie, but I'm not sure I'd rate it too high....."
1834,"I'm not sure I want to see ""Fay Grim"", but after watching ""Henry Fool"" I'm not sure I want to. Maybe Hartley aims to be the ""anti-thriller"" director---he sure succeeded with this"

1841,"I used to love the bill because of its great script and characters, but lately i feel as though it has turned into an emotional type of soap. This proves that it has changed a lot from being an absolutely amazing Police drama to an average"

1846,There are B-Grade Movies and there are B-Grade Movies and this definitely falls into the latter. However since it's obvious that even the makers of the film know that it's not a credible movie...

1849,I'm sorry but I do not see the 'fun' in this. Just the thrill of pointing the many mistakes and stupid one-liners. Well I'm wondering how dumb the directors think of their producing company when this movie was

1852,"Not as bad as I thought it would be, but not as good as I thought it would be......"
1853,"Good low-budget B-movie comedy, but a bad low-budget B-movie horror. I saw it on cable and I'm glad I didn't pay money to see it."
1854,"Jack Frost, no kids it's not the warm hearted family movie about a dad who comes back from the dead in the form of a snow man. It's about a sadistic killer named Jack Frost who is sprayed with some acid fluid"
1855,"I am so happy and surprised that there is so much interest in this movie! Jack Frost was my introduction into the films produced and distributed by A-pix entertainment, and without exception, everything this company deals with is pure crap!"
1856,This is the crappiest film I have ever seen. I don't think the film-makers intended it to be your typical Hollywood blockbuster quality. It's just a stupid film about a serial killer who gets doused in a load

1866,"Losing Control is another erotic thriller which could be considered as the pulp fiction of the film world. This is not a complaint, especially when it is done by the stunningly beautiful women who invariably inhabit this make-believe world."
1867,I think this show looks pretty cheaply made. Some of the actors are terrible. I can always tell how it's going to end within the first 10 minutes or less of watching...
1868,"What ever you do, try not to fall asleep watching this movie.........."
1869,This is my first movie review on IMDb. I was forced to register after watching this movie. I cannot in good conscience allow this movie to be unreviewed by me. The people must be warned!
1870,"This movie sucks, its good or its just plain weird. The third one probably explains this movie best. So who else but Christopher Walken would play in this no matter how bad, average or even how good it might be"

1886,I'm not sure what. I just couldn't laugh at it. I seriously just couldn't laugh at this film. It was just not funny to me. Some parts it seemed like Ben Stiller and Jack Black tried too

1910,One of Flynn's last big adventure films. He's too old to play this type of action/adventure type of film any longer. He's got some nasty people after him.
1911,"This movie does not rock, as others have said. I found it really boring and silly. The story is about this metal high school kid who idolizes this really bad heavy metal singer."

1915,One of the worst films I've seen in a long time. brbr br br br br br br br br br 
1916,Too many sub-plots competing for screen time. A lack of a main plot is the biggest problem. A lack of character development is the real problem.

1919,"The worst vampire movie I've ever seen, and I've seen it more than once........"
1920,"The worst ""film"" I've ever seen. Worse than The Avengers. Incompetent directing, writing, and awful acting are the only consistent elements throughout. Shot on very cheap video, it looks like a high school project, but without"
1921,Not even good enough to be called a B rated movie. Do not waste your money or your time on this movie. Just listing to the voice over and the horrible music made me sick.

1935,"I gave this two stars for the awesome DV shot clarity, which lends to the cold and dark sterility of its character. That was being generous, I know."

1951,"Self-centered and self-deserving of her husband's attention..<n>The worst movie I've seen in a long, long time."

1967,I found the pace to be glacial and the original story blown way out of proportion to the content. My wife slept through most of it and I did not try to wake her...

1980,This was an excellent idea and the scenery was beautiful but that's where it ends. It seemed like a lackluster Set It Off meets The West. The plot barely made any sense.
1981,"One of the WORST movies I've ever seen. Must have to agree with the other reviewer. This has got to be the WORST movie, let alone western I have ever seen."
1982,"the costumes, the dialog, historical accuracy are terrible. For instance, - Stacey Dash and the hanging scene. The noose was accurate ( as for as I could tell), but that type of noose broke the person's neck."
1983,An absolute steaming pile of cow dung. It's mind-blowing to me that this film was even made. What target audience were these people thinking of when planning this trainwreck?

1990,"Don't Tell Me... They threw out the movie and kept the out takes. You know, This movie could have been shot in a back alley in New York. The ""Gangster Bangster"" I guess."
1991,This is just one bad cliché after another. This movie made hardly any money for a good reason. The appeal of black cowboy movies just isn't there. It's a shame they didn't have a good story to tell.
1992,"This is the worst western I have ever seen in my life! I don't care if you're white or black,it's bad!"
1993,Don't blame historical inaccuracy for the fact that you just didn't dig it. Maybe you're just uncomfortable with what you're seeing

1996,Wenders's music is the only thing that makes this film interesting.........
1997,"It's a waste of time, because the figureheads on the ships act better than the humans. It's a mercy that Anthony Quinn couldn't persuade anyone else to let him direct any other films after this turkey."
1998,"Don't waste your time, money, or energy on this movie. It's a waste of your time and money. It's a waste of your money."
1999,The Tooth Fairy is just another poor straight-to-video horror film that fails to distinguish itself from the countless other's which litter video shop shelves & fill late night cable TV schedules.

2116,Bela Lugosi plays Dr. Lorenz who loves his wife so much that he will do anything to keep her young. This film starts off with a wedding as the bride is about to take her vows she suddenly collapses. She is pronounced dead and
2117,Bela Lugosi is great as usual but the movie is nothing compared to Dracula. He is probably the only one that played a perfect part in this movie but not even a legend like Lugosi could save the badness of the idea of this

2310,What is this movie offering? Out of control editing and cinematography that matches up with a terrible plot. It is sad to see Denzel Washington's talents go wasted in trashes like this.
2311,"Is it just me, or does it seem to have been inspired, at least in part, by this film? Both are set in similar communities, but the film was a hilarious mockumentary without all the serious undertones"

2324,"Hood of the Living Dead gets a 3 out of 10, a little entertainment here and there but it only succeeds as a low budget cringe fest. The only true good moment of this film is the outtakes."

2836,"The plot was quite interesting, with the Russian revolution background. I also enjoyed seeing Budapest as the movie was partly filmed there. Sadly, there was zero chemistry between the 2 main characters so it was hard to believe the love story between them."
2837,"It's not very good but then it's not very bad either, like most of the little yellow pocket books. And the location stuff in Budapest is especially interesting, even if they didn't use the wonderful old train station..."

2887,the worst horror/thriller I've seen in my 29 years. If someone offers this to you for free tell them NO. This movie makes you a dumber person for knowing you watched it.
2888,I rented this horrible movie. The worst think I have ever seen. I believe a 1st grade class could have done a better job. I would rather watch killer clowns from outer space while sitting in a bucket of razors than sit through

2908,"Not Huston's best work,but still a great movie.<n>Poor acting,poor direction,poor plot.Poor acting,poor acting,poor story."
2909,Unbelievably jingoistic and demeaning to the Japanese. Hollywood in the fifties still believed that everybody in the world loved Americans. The movie deals with the nineteenth century isolationism of Japan. Maybe it's Hollywood that should be

2913,"What a dreadful film. The only reason you would want to sit through this mess is the pleasurable sight of Miss Eleniak. Mr McNamara is no Tom Cruise, the actor he obviously wants to be."
2914,"This movie down-shifts from 4th into 1st without bothering with 3rd or 2nd, grinding gears all the way to the sappy, b-movie finish-line"
2915,This is one of the very worst films Clark Gable made. Only PARNELL was obviously worse. It is just so painfully clichéd and the dialog is so lousy that it is something neither Gable nor Jean Harlow should have been proud of making.
2916,"Sakura Killers is a goofy ninja movie, but it's also an incredibly enjoyable one. This is largely thanks to the awesome presence of one Chuck Connors, who is billed as starring in the movie but really only shines in a few"

2920,"It's not really any good, but it's great to laugh at. The dialogue can become incredibly ludicrous and poorly acted (eg, ""Manji, can we ask you a few questions... ""Sure."" ""We think you"

2927,"Not the worst of Caine's films, but not a great one either.<n>An average chase thriller with a talented cast, exotic locations, stretches and a highly formulaic storyline."
2928,"It's better than Caine believes, although it's not much cop. Britain's greatest ever screen actor does not seem too interested in this role, which is a pity as he might have elevated it with more conviction in his playing"
2929,"What an incredible waste of time. The aroma of tax write off is permeating the air. The rest of the cast has such folks as William Holden, Rex Harrison, Omar Sharif and Kebir Bedi in parts and looking so incredibly"

2948,Not even good enough to stand on it's own..........
2949,"This is a terrible remake of a marginal, but well liked, movie from the early 70's. I have seen the original at least 6 times. The 1997 version is a 20 minute movie 'crammed' into 2 hours or whatever"
2950,"This remake is a sad reflection of the times it was made in. The original is a cult classic and golden. I'm glad I watched it however, it made me appreciate the original that much more."
2951,Why stick with a white Challenger? I didn't think that was the best choice back in '71. Some parts of the film were unintentionally hilarious.

2968,Creepy--but not as bad as I thought it would be--and still do--in the 60's/early 70's!
2969,"This movie scared the hell out of me. You may be asking yourself, how could a movie about Santa Clause scare anyone? The plot of the movie revolves around Satan sending one his minions, Pitch, to earth in an attempt to kill Santa"
2970,I'm not sure if it was a dollar well spent or a dollar foolishly wasted. I liked it a lot. And Santa is impressive. One of the more impressive Santas in moviedom.

2992,One of the worst films I've ever seen. Why did Domino become such a bad-ass tough bitch? Why did Domino become such a bad-ass tough bitch?
2993,Keira Knightley ruined all future films for me with this role. In the 2nd Pirates movie when it came out I went to see it. All I saw was Domino Harvey and I hated her more for it.
2994,"""Domino"" is a film that begins with little potential, and dashes that infinitesimal amount before the sixty-minute mark. With an already-distended running time of 128 minutes, the film feels twice as long."
2995,"One of the worst films I've seen in a long, long time........"
2996,"How can you take her hard-living, glamorously violent bounty hunter story serious with *that* accent? It's absurd. Apart from that, the visual style of the directer is nauseating and rehash..."
2997,What do you get when you mix a lump of clichés with a directionless pacing and a group of characters who you don't care about and a really big budget?
2998,"Tony Scott was trying too hard. It was all just too much. Oh, and the echoing of some of Keira's lines simply sounded cheesy after hearing it for the second, third, fourth time, and so on."

3082,This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life. I don't know what I'm going to do with my life.

3098,This movie is similar to the play entitled 'Blithe Spirit' written by Noel Coward. I'm surprised that movies of this nature don't acknowledge the original writer's concept.
3099,"The worst romantic comedy I've seen in a long, long time........."

3114,"Not as good as I thought it would be, but not as bad as I thought it would be......."
3115,"I love Michael Vartan! But this film really lets him down. His acting is still superb, he's still as charming as ever, and he still looks great. But the film itself is a load of rubbish!"
3116,"Great movie - especially the music - Etta James - ""At Last."" This speaks volumes when you have finally found that special someone. This speaks volumes when you have finally found that special someone."
3117,It's a typical rom-com with an ending you can see coming before you've seen so much as the trailer. The key difference is that the classic rom-coms tackle their stories with wit and a lack of pretension.

3119,The worst indie movie I've seen in a long time..........

3534,This show is a parody of sitcoms and society. It simply isn't funny. A woman farting has been done in comedy many times because its not something that's common. We don't need 25 minutes of it.

3689,"The worst slasher film of all time, but it ranks very high for me. It is how a slasher movie should be. Get a case of cheap beer and some friends, watch it and laugh."
3690,"the cover of the box makes this movie look really good, don't be fooled. splatter university came out in 1984 which was the last good year for horror, but this movie sucks."

3723,Charlton Heston and James Coburn in the worst western ever made.........
3724,"Stereotyped, derivative, unoriginal and boring Western. Heston is so old he has trouble riding a horse and Coburn is mean and tough but not as cold-blooded a killer as some of the minor villains."

3746,This movie sucked. A LOT. I have been reading some of the other reviews. Apparently there are a lot of people that think that anything Woody Allen writes or stars in is automatically good...

3865,"Oh my god, what a horrible film. The film has all the right people involved, unfortunately it is not worth watching. I saw it for free at my local library. If I had paid to watch this I would be even more upset"
3866,What happens when you're living in China and the local video store is running thin on English-language titles? This is what happens when you're living in China and the local video store is running thin on English-language titles?
3867,"This film is a joke and Quinton should be ashamed of himself, trying to pass this off as a Modesty Blaise Film. If you are having trouble sleeping then all means rent this film."
3868,"Cheesy script, cheesy one-liners. Timothy Hutton's performance a ""little"" over the top. David Duchovny still seemed to be stuck in his Fox Mulder mode"
3869,"Not even Timothy Hutton and David Duchovny could save this dead fish of a film. For starters, the script was definitely written to be made into a B-film, but somehow Duchovny and Hutton became attached to the picture."
3870,"It's hard to believe that David Duchovny was at the top of his fame, with X-Files, one of the best sci-fi series ever, being at the top of the glory. Nine years later he is almost"
3871,"I thought this might be insipid but it was even worse than I imagined. Sometimes I like to watch a good ""car-crash"" movie: those that are so bad that you can't look away because you want to see"
3872,"Cool idea... botched writing, botched directing, botched editing, botched acting. Sorta makes me wish I could play God and strike everyone involved in making this film with several bolts of lightning."
3873,"Not the greatest, but it does entertain. Timothy Hutton seems to over act in most of the scenes. Gary Dourdan,(Yates), plays a real COOL DUDE who is a so-called body guard for Raymond Blossom."
3874,"The Adventures of Barry McKenzie can still be funny, but its over-the-top political incorrectness and blunt, unsubtle humour can make it a bit of a cringer."
3875,"One of Renny H. Harlin's best films, and Viggo Mortensen is excellent as usual in the lead role, supported by some very authentic-looking prisoners (there are no pretty boys in this cast)"
3876,One of the worst horror films I've seen in a long time!brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
3877,"The Second Renaissance, part 1 - too violent and too silly. 4/10. As for Second Renaissance Part 1, I'd say it's too violent and too silly."
3878,"If this is all the Watchowski's have to offer in terms of a back story to the Matrix, than I really have to question the claims of all of the fans who believe that the movies are intended to register on a deeper level"
3879,"""Now is the time"" when a certain man will die and must be replaced to guard a certain gate in that high-rise. Why Cristina suffers through the trauma she does isn't adequately explained."
3880,"A so common horror story about a luxury building at Brooklyn which hides the gates to hell. It is reminiscent of Polanski's ""The Tenant"" (released a year before ""The sentinel""), but is too far from the movie of"
3881,Marishcka Detmers in the nude in a soap opera with a man's penis in her mouth. A real waste of time.
3882,Good acting by Detmers only helps to a certain point. Dull and slow. If it didn't have that sequence this movie would have been forgotten long ago. You can skip this one

3884,One of the worst movies I've ever seen...........
3885,"Predictable parody, just about failed to impress. The only thing that made it worthwhile was the DO NOT COLORIZE line at the end credits. Shame something more entertaining wasn't put on the DVD"
3886,"Not as good as ""Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Attack of the Evil, Mutant, Alien, Flesh Eating, Hell"
3887,"I'd rather examine the colon of an African elephant with a penlight than sit through this again. I think I've wasted enough time watching this ""movie"" - I don't need to waste more..."
3888,This movie is not as good as all think. the actors are lowlevel and the story is very comic-like. I respect fantasy but Lord of the Rings is fantasy...Conan..is fantasy...THIS IS JUST NORMAL HK
3889,One of the worst movies I've rented based on an IMDb review.........
3890,"The house of the spirits is not a movie, it's an insult to the intelligence of those who live in the country it's based on."
3891,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, but it doesn't live up to the book...."
3892,Don't see this film. It will ruin for you what could be a wonderful experience. It will ruin for you what could be a wonderful experience.
3893,"I don't know what to say about this movie, but I think it sucks!!! I read the novel some years ago and I liked it a lot. when I saw the movie I couldn't believe it..."
3894,"This movie is a waste of time, money, and time. The book is what should be read and the movie is what should be seen. A good example of how to ruin a book in 109 minutes."
3895,I don't think I've ever seen a movie that was so bad. I don't think I've ever seen a movie that was so bad.

3899,"A nice try, with nice messages, and a bone yawnfest. As it stands, it was a nice try, with nice messages, and a yawnfest."
3900,I'm glad I rented this movie for one reason: its shortcomings made me want to read Allende's book and get the full story. I'm very curious now whether this movie is typical of Bille August's work.
3901,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Considering the talent involved, this has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen."
3902,"Forget Plan 9! This is the worst movie of all time. It totally sucks!!! I hate Meryl Streep and Antonio Banderas (in non-Spanish films), and the other actors, including Winona, my favourite actress and Jeremy"
3903,"Not as good as the Paltrow version, but not as bad as the Knightley version...but it's not as good as the Paltrow one either."
3904,The worst adaptation of a Jane Austen novel I've ever seen. I can't understand why anyone would want to be Emma. I can't understand why anyone would want to be Mr Knightley.
3905,"This is a god adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. Compared with the American Version with Guinneth Paltrow, the script was written to resemble as much as possible the book. But the acting was awful"
3906,"Not as good as the motion version, but not bad either.<n>Not as bad as the TV version, but not as good as the film."
3907,"Not as good as the book, but not as bad as the big American version either......."
3908,"This is not the story of Lale Andersen or the song Lili Marlene, rather it is a Hollywood (or pick your film making hub) story loosely based on some real life characters"
3909,"I am terribly sorry, I know that Fabinder still is called one of the greatest directors in post-war Germany and that most of his films are considered ""master-pieces"""
3910,Labored comedy with Debbie Reynolds as the tomboy farmer's daughter who puts the squeeze on the not-so-disinterested tax-man. Debbie certainly made her share of inferior theatrical sitcoms during this period--and this one'

3912,"A movie about a guy that got shot into space, and then he gets a nose bleed, and then an overweight nurse with an ill-fitting uniform comes in and gets eaten by the guy"
3913,It's just too 70's for me to hate it. It's tacky and trashy but I thought it was a lot of fun. You could do a lot worse.
3914,"I was thinking that the main character, the astronaut with the bad case of the runs(in his case, his skin, hair, muscles, etc) could always get more movie work after he'd been reduced to a puddle"
3915,"Don't watch this film if you want to see a guy melt. See Raiders of the Lost Ark if you want to see a guy melt. I can not, in all good conscience, recommend this film to the sober film-going"
3916,One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life.........
3917,"Disgusting, disgusting, disgusting. Disgusting. Disgusting. Disgusting. Disgusting. Disgusting. Disgusting. Disgusting. Disgusting. Disgusting."
3918,"Not as good as I thought it would be, but if you love bad movies, you'll enjoy the Fat Nurse exit, and the stellar acting of the guy who plays Dr. Ted"
3919,"I have begun to melt so I will make this review as short and sweet as possible.brbrI've very nearly melted, but I still have enough time left to tell you that this movie is dreadfully boring..."
3920,"Worst B-Movie I've seen in a long time, and I've seen it with the MST3K version, but not this one."
3921,Is this a stupid movie? You bet!! I could not find any moment in this film that was creepy or scary. Stupid characters? You bet.
3922,This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life - and it's not just because it's bad. It's bad. It's bad. It's bad. It's bad. It's
3923,"The ""Incredible Melting Man"" is perhaps the worst movie known to man. It makes movies such as ""Def-Con 4, ""Metalstorm"", and ""Freddie Got Fingered"" look like Oscar nominees. I feel violated for wasting almost"
3924,"It's not the worst of the worst but it's pretty freaking bad. I can't say I've ever actually SEEN a real, live melting man - incredible, or otherwise - but I'd have to say"
3925,"The only redeeming feature of this picture would be that truly grotesque makeup job by the legendary Rick Baker. As for creepy, I'll give the nod to that horny old geezer couple sucking on lemons just before lights out. Now they"
3926,"Not as bad as I thought it would be, but not as bad as I thought it would be......"
3927,"I can watch a good gory film now and then. I've seen some pretty sick stuff. However, this is one of the few films that I found to be grotesque in a way that was just plain repulsive and revolting."
3928,"Good premise, weak script, poor acting, and gore effects only hold your interest for the most die-hard monster movie fans           "

3930,"It's a cult classic, but it's not that great at all. I'll give it marks for its cheese factor but that's about it. If you want a sci-fi/horror cult classic, watch The"
3931,"The movie had so much potential, but due to 70's technology constraints and also a weak script killed the main plot of the film. The book version of the film was much better, and well conceived."
3932,"I've seen a lot of stupid plotlines in my time, but this one is among the worst. After catching some disease in space, an astronaut comes back to Earth and starts melting. He then goes on a rampage, killing people"
3933,It could have been so much better.. so much better.. so much better.. so much better.. so much better.. so much better.. so much better.. so much better.. so much better.
3934,"Not as good as ""Clueless"" but still worth a look........."
3935,"If one has nothing to do except watch a movie, this won't look so bad -- if one has nothing to do except watch a movie, this won't look so bad"
3936,"This movie was just a dud. Period. The premise was terrible. The main character, Mary Gordano (Alicia Silverstone) was unbelievable as a high school senior with an unquenchable desire to solve crimes. There was not enough depth"
3937,"Ichikawa Somegoro's best work, but it's lost in all the goo......"
3938,This is the 2nd time I've seen this movie in about 12 years. But the remainder of Welles career is squandered on material unworthy of his talent and too flimsy to withstand his filmic embroidering
3939,"If you are studying Welles and want to see just how far he fell after Citizen Kane, this film will prove it. The cheap excuse of making the protagonist a self-admitted dummy fails to explain the absurd courtroom theatrics and ridiculous plot twists"
3940,"Not as good as I thought it would be, but at least it's not as bad as I thought it would be...."
3941,"I thought this movie had absolutely no moral. I mean, how would you feel if your fiancé left you on your wedding day for your cousin??? I thought it just mostly found cheap laughs and took them."
3942,It's so awful that we're having a hard time looking away from the screen. We just have to know where this trainwreck goes. But that's only because we caught it on TV
3943,"Just a regular Jason lee movie, There were some parts of the movie that were funny. The undertone of the move is to live life on the edge I guess."
3944,One of the worst movies I've ever seen...and I don't even know what I'm talking about...and I'm not even sure what I'm talking about!
3945,"A couple of laughs, but nothing to write home about. Jason Lee looked like he was having fun. The (long) DVD gag reel consists almost solely of him having fits of uncontrollable laughter. Selma Blair seemed to be punching a time clock"
3946,I'm not a big fan of rom/coms at the best of times. A few have been quite good (check of Dream for an Insomniac)

3948,"Jason Lee does his best to bring fun to a silly situation, but the movie just fails to make a connect. Perhaps because Julia Stiles character seems awkward as the conniving and sexy soon to be cousin-in-law."
3949,"One of the worst movies I have seen in my life. I usually love movies like this, the whole ""A guy meets an eccentric woman who he likes, but he happens to already be involved with someone, who not right for him."
3950,"Don't waste your time here, don't waste your money here. See something else, don't waste your time here. See something else, don't waste your time here."
3951,"""A Guy Thing"" tries to capture the feeling of ""There's Something About Mary"" or ""Meet the Parents"" but comes off more like it was edited up out of cutting-room rejects of those two films"
3952,"The only redemption was the small part by Larry Miller. It seemed that the movie was trying too hard to be ""Something About Mary,"" but I didn't even like that movie and it still fell short of those standards."
3953,"Julia Stiles is a talented young actress, who with guidance from a reputable agent has a lot of potential. Obviously, the person who guided her into this travesty is..."
3954,"The worst film I've seen in a long time, and it's not Jason Lee's fault, it's Fletch's."
3955,"This was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen I don't really know why Just your run-of-the-mill stories about guy who is about to get married, and starts to fancy someone else instead"

3957,One of the worst films I've seen in a long time - and I've seen it with the director in attendance......
3958,Debbie Reynolds tap-dances her way through this ordinary thriller. Not an ounce of honest fun in the whole tepid package. Not an ounce of honest fun in the whole tepid package.
3959,Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters team up as the mothers of convicted murderers. The film is almost laughable with Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters teaming up as the mothers of convicted murderers.

3964,"One of the finest horror films of the '70s, if not the '50s......."
3965,"I was so horrified by this movie, I could barely watch it. It was mainly the scene with Shirley McClain cutting that little girl in half, and then there was the boy with ketchup!"
3966,"Not Roeg's best work, but it's still a good turkey movie, even if it's a little over-rated......."
3967,A big let down after all the hyped reviews :(                   
3968,"""All In The Family"" was a brilliant show for its first four or five years and I bet I watched every episode more than once. However, I swear that I did NOT know a show named ""Gloria"" existed. Maybe, that"
3969,"The worst of Fulci's low-budget ""sword and sorcery"" films...yet again!              "
3970,"Not Fulci's best work, but it's still worth a watch........"
3971,"I like Fulci films, i really do and not in some boring ironic way either but i recognise that they appear hopelessly inept and garbled to lots of people."
3972,"Unwatchable, unwatchable, unwatchable, unwatchable, unwatchable, unwatchable, unwatchable, unwatchable, unwatchable, unwatchable, unwatchable, unwatchable,"
3973,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long, long time........"
3974,"Almost impressively bad. Note I said, ""almost"". This is nothing more than lots of random scenes strung together in a loose attempt at a story. Go rent the original Conan DVD instead."
3975,This was a watershed event in my movie watching life. I was completely amazed at just how bad it was. Every film student should see this thing just so they'll know the very definition of a bad movie.
3976,mish-mash of other FAR better sword & sorcery epics. Lack of cohesion runs rampant as does banality. Even the main villaness refusing to wear clothing other then a loincloth is pretty boring.Mildly amusing in it'
3977,"This is not Shakespeare, it is not cinema. There is a time and place for it, but I will not waste my time and there is no place for it in my studies of Shakespeare"

3979,"This is the movie that I think of...days later. I bailed on this movie some 20 odd minutes into it...think I realised that my toenails wouldn't clip themselves, and they were looking at me imploringly to get cut"
3980,"I'm not a fan of this movie, but I don't think I'm a fan of this movie either...."
3981,"This film was just painful to watch... not in the good dramatic way that makes you cringe with emotions for well developed characters in dramatic situations (yeah, I pretty much made that last sentence up as I went along)"
3982,This is not the worst film I have seen of Peter Greenaway but it is close dishonor. That goes to the even worse Pillow Book. This director's films of 3 I have seen I find them all to be miserable
3983,"It's a bit pretentious, but it's not a bad movie, but it's not a great one. I don't know what I'm going to do with it."
3984,"Not as good as I thought it would be, but there are some good moments in the movie. I'm not sure what happened at the end."
3985,JESSICA: A GHOST STORY is as the name implies a ghost story. The theme is meant to be horror but comes across closer to comedy!
3986,"What do you get when you have bad acting, bad directing, terrible lighting, painful editing, and awful effects? You get Jessica: A Ghost Story Seems its shot on betacam, which is fine, but the lighting has to compliment this"
3987,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long, long time........."

3996,I'll keep this film forever just because it SOOOOO bad it's almost good....in a really bad way....a real crap-movie classic!
3997,"One of the worst exploitation films I've seen in a long time, but I'll give it a 3/10 for the fact that it's a little higher than its current average."
3998,"It's not a great movie, but it's not a bad movie either.brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr"
3999,"This movie is extremely boring, it tells a story of a female gas station owner and her life. Nothing exciting ever happens. The director has really ""kept it real"" and it feels just like a camera following a woman around as she lives"
4000,"One good scene, but the rest of the film is a waste of time.<n>Faat Kine has the problem of running two hours long with an extremely drawn out finale."
4001,"The worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life - and I've seen it in a theater, too............"

4006,"If you grew up during the Vietnam Was, then you've seen and heard all of the film footage and arguments here a hundred times by now. But what really makes this film boring is the narration by director Carlton Sherwood."
4007,"The British Public School system did not evolve solely with the idea of educating the upper classes.It was designed to produce administrators and governors,civil servants and military men to run the British Colonies.These people were almost entirely recruited from the middle classes"
4008,"If you're like me and you're working towards making a life for yourself instead of just blindly (very in this movie) rebelling against ""the man"", this movie is juvenile and boring"

4012,One of the worst movies Ive ever seen...........
4013,"It's like in the army, you learn to obey and do what you're asked to. Yes the young dream of something else but it breaks their dreams and sweeps away their optimism on the threshold of life."
4014,"""Stripes"" is a movie of its era, it hasn't aged well and is not worth watching. If you want to watch an early 80's ""buddy"" comedy I would recommend ""Stir Crazy."""
4015,Is this really funny? Is it worth it? Is it worth it? Is it worth it? Is it worth it? Is it worth it? Is it worth it?
4016,"I've never been a fan of Bill Murray, but this just sums him up really. I can safely say that I haven't wasted my time so blatantly like this since seeing the first running of Operation Delta Force over here."
4017,"What an insult to the SA film industry! I have seen better SA films. The comments I read about Hijack Stories,by saying it is worthy of a ten out of ten is quite scary. A movie's rating should not depend"
4018,"Poorly made, poorly edited, poorly paced and tedious piece of low budget drivel that fails on all counts. I'm surprised it made it outside of South Africa, and even more surprised it made it to a DVD release."
4019,One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more times than I've seen this movie. I've seen it more times than I've seen this movie.
4020,"A film that lingers too long in a sepia world of distance and alienation. We are left hanging, but with nothing much else save languid shots of grave and pensive male faces to savour."
4021,"This film is beautiful to look at, but is like watching really bad experimental theater. The plot (if there was one) doesn't make any sense. But it is very ""artistic"". Lots of shots of half-dressed actors wrestling"
4022,"One of the worst movies ever. Positively, absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt one of the worst movies ever. Pure torture. One long, tedious, labored, pretentious, self-conscious, theatrical, and leadenly artsy"
4023,"Not all art films are better than King Kong. I quite possibly would give Kong two stars, double this film's haul. For the less discerning art-buff, a film that looks like a play is 'great art'"

4032,It's a dreadful cheat of a film. Its 70-minute running time is very well padded with stock footage. The rest are non descript exteriors and drab interiors scenes. They are all just perfunctory scenes sort of strung together

4386,"A class C film with OK acting but some troubles directing and some continuity errors. There isn't much zombie action in this one and the effects, while adequate, are nothing special. You can fast forward through the slow parts and get some"
4387,One of the worst direct-to-video horror flicks I've ever seen..and I've seen more than one..and I've seen more than one..and I've seen more than one..
4388,One of the worst horror films I've seen in a long time.........
4389,"Too much love for the music, too much parties, too much contrast between the nice lives of the main characters (come on, it's not so sad)"
4390,"""Triumph of Love"" is proof that not every Comédie-Franaise author who uses cross-dressing disguised courtship like Shakespeare is worth seeing."
4391,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I've never seen such a contrast of pretense and incompetence. Never, though, have i seen such a contrast of high intentions and failure."
4392,"Not the best of Peploe's films, but not the worst of Bertolucci's films either....."
4393,"Mira Sorvino is SO bad in this movie, it is very painful to watch the scene with her. She is not seductive at all, but I will have to witness her awkward attempt to seduce almost all the other major characters."
4394,"The Triumph of Love doesn't triumph over anything. It is a plodding, ponderous, 4 hours of torture. Actually it's a little less than 2 hours long, it just seemed much longer. It pains me to even think"
4395,"Stupid, stupid story and horrible production. Do NOT waste your video rental $. Do NOT waste your video rental $. Do NOT waste your video rental $. Do NOT waste your video rental $. Do NOT waste your video rental $."
4396,The worst movie I've ever seen in a long time..........
4397,"The worst movie I've seen in a long, long time........."
4398,I wanted to like this movie a lot more than I did. That's because I love wacky foreign comedies--particularly the strange ones that catch you completely by surprise.
4399,"Just like in a sitcom, which is what this is, with the added 'bonus' of delusions of grandeur and a 110-minute running time. That's right: just like in a sitcom, which is what this is."

4405,I don't think I've ever seen a movie that was as bad as this one! I don't think I've ever seen a movie that was so bad!
4406,"One of the few films dealing with gay men that does NOT shy away from sex scenes (not that explicit and no frontal). Still, I mostly hated this."
4407,Another 'gay' film with the black side! Why is it so bad? It's supposed to be 'gay'...not glum!?
4408,"One of many nearly forgotten movies from the 1930's resurrected by the magic of DVD. Unfortunately, no one else here can really act worth a darn."
4409,This one is a real bomb. We are supposed to believe that Merle Oberon is the sequestered daughter of an ambitious politician who must prove to the Tom DeLay of the 1930s that he is worth supporting as a presidential candidate.
4410,"Interesting subject, but quickly turned into an insider's view of wargaming with an almost stereotypical thumbing of the nose to viewers who ""don't get it"""

4417,"Same tone as Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All For You, but it doesn't work at all....."
4418,"What is shocking and wild in college rarely holds up over time, and this is proof. To take on the Catholic Church with broadside humor just isn't shocking or interesting or funny, it's kind of boring."
4419,TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! Complete waste of time! I strongly suggest you do not watch this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4420,"Michael Rooker is a decent actor, but he has no business being the lead except in a low budget movie. Ryo Ishibashi has a lot more screen presence, and sadly he is not really the main character."

4430,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is without doubt one of the worst movies ever. It is not that i don't like cult-movies I do. But nothing happens in the film.
4431,"One of Frances Farmer's earliest movies; at 22, she is absolutely beautiful. Bing Crosby is in great voice, but the songs are not his best. Martha Raye and Bob Burns are interesting, but their comedy, probably great in its"

4435,"Not as good as the History Channel's Goebbels documentary, but not as bad as the History Channel's Goebbels documentary."
4436,"Not as good as the original, but not as bad as the Fairly Odd Parents/Sponge Bob episodes. A better choice than Legend of Frosty the Snowman."

4439,"""Severed Ties"" is pretty good,but the rest of the film is awful.Big deal.The severed arm is behaving like a snake and kills few people.Big deal.The acting is mediocre and the climax is silly.3"
4440,"Not a bad flick by Fangoria films; just there are better ones out there, which are similar in vein. ""Servered Ties"" simply lacks it own distinctive style. The oddball nature and unpleasant splatter resembled ""Re-animator"
4441,I thought this was going to be about an arm thats got a mind of its own as seen in THE BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS or THE HAND or someone getting an arm transplant as in BODY

4461,"Not as good as ""The Incredible Mr. Limpet,"" but not as bad as ""Three's Company"" or ""The Dreamer of Oz"""
4462,"Juggernaut is a British made ""thriller"" released in the US by First National. Karloff is Dr. Sartorius who has to leave his research because his funds have dried up."
4463,"It's not a horror flick, but a drama where Boris is a struggling scientist agreeing to kill a wealthy woman's husband in order to gain the fortune needed to continue with his work."
4464,One of Boris Karloff's real clinkers. Essentially the dying Karloff (looking about 120 years older than he was)is a scientist in need of cash to finish his experiments before he dies.
4465,"""Roadrunners"" really was upsetting. You could put up with the silliness premise but have a character who has been developed over a good 7 years as a rational skeptic transformed into a gullible maverick purely for the sake of advancing the plot is bizarre"
4466,Ariauna Albright is a really good actress but why she participated in this lame written travesty is a mystery. What could have been entertaining winds up as classic boredom.
4467,The only saving grace is the body of Ariauna in her sexy uniform. Her humour is also to be appreciated. She is a definite plus but alas it would take a magician to salvage this garbage.
4468,The worst movie I've seen in a long time & I've seen it more than once...........

4470,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time, but I'll give it 5 stars if it doesn't cost me money."
4471,"This movie tries to look ""genuine"" and the characters should be supposed ""real people"". An Italian could never think that the characters might be ""real"": they are just ""low-profile"" stereotypes."
4472,"""Barricade"" isn't total trash but the problem seems to be exactly that. Timo Rose tries to walk in the footsteps of German Horror/Splatter Cinema like Olaf Ittenbach and the likes. That means ""Barrica"
4473,"I'll never get back on this piece of trash. I heard someone online describe this movie's villains as ""subhuman cannibals"", and I thought it was promising because I thought it would be like the Descent. WRONG"
4474,"Barricade 3 is a bloody, but unwatchable gore-fest........"
4475,"I'm not a blood and guts fan, but I'm sure this movie could have been better if it wasn't for the gory scenes!"
4476,Horrible. I see many user comments on how great this show is. It truly is a Wanna-Be-Friends - Made in Taiwan knockoff. The jokes are lame as...and the plot is ridiculous.

4486,"I thought it might be interesting. But implausibility was piled upon implausibility. Each turn of the plot seemed to be an excuse to drag in more bloodshed, gruesome makeup, or special effects."
4487,"This movie was predictable and pretty boring. The acting was below average most of the time. I haven't seen a more pathetic attempt at making someone ""badass"" in a movie. Oh man, this movie was a letdown"

4499,I created my own reality by walking out of the theater I was roped in by my girlfriend into going to this dreck with her mom. We (my g-friend and I) walked out about an hour into it.
4500,"""What the Bleep do we Know"" will go down in history as the single worst movie I have ever seen in its entirety. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is impressive indeed, for I have seen many a bad movie."
4501,"If you're a layman interested in quantum theory and string theory, read ""The Elegant Universe"" by Brian Greene of Columbia University, and ""The Universe in a Nutshell"" by Stephen Hawking of Cambridge."
4502,"I was extremely suspicious of the ideas presented in this movie. I was relatively ignorant of quantum physics aside from what I recalled from the excellent ""Short History of Nearly Everything"" and what I was able to choke down in ""A Brief History of"

4504,"If you want to see intelligent, philosophical discussion of human possibility and potential, watch ""Waking Life,"" which is brilliant. ""What the #$*! Do We Know"" is all over the place in its focus"
4505,"If you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics, spend your $9 on a used textbook, not this movie. I'm a little worried that the money I spent is being used to buy Kool-Aid for shipment to Guyana."
4506,Pathetic attempt to use science to justify new age religion/philosophy. The two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about Quantum Physics in this mess is just plain wrong.
4507,"If you're open-minded, you'll find this to be a waste of time and money - and you'll find it to be a waste of time, too."

4514,"It's not a story, it's just a bunch of New Age blowhards talking about how little they know about basic quantum mechanics. I say it belongs more in the Documentary category than Comedy or Drama."

4518,I can't believe that the City of Muncie is so hard up for attention that they would embarrass themselves by allowing this show to be done there. This show is like a slap in the face to real hard working law-enforcement officers.
4519,What a slap in the face to real law enforcement. The worst part of the series is that it attempts to bill itself as reality fare -- and is anything but. Men and women that dedicate their lives to the enforcement of laws deserve better than

4539,Boring. Minimal plot. No character development. I went into this movie with high expectations from the book. It COULD have been an awesome movie. It COULD have probably become a cult classic. Nope. It was a giant let-down.
4540,One of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. Don't see this movie. Don't read this book. Don't watch this movie.
4541,The book looses a lot in this movie...........
4542,"One of the worst films I've seen in a long, long time........"
4543,This movie is just not worth your time. Its reliance upon New-Age mysticism serves as its only semi-interesting distraction. The plot is one that has been re-cycled countless times.

4551,This movie is nothing but a religious tract promoting classic Hinduism and New Age Occultism dressed up with Western images to be swallowed by those who are ignorant of foundational religious comparisons.
4552,"Not the best of the book, not the best of the movie, but not the worst of the movie either. The worst part was the slow moving interactions of the actors which combined with endless meaningful glances."

4736,"Why don't blockbusters simply stick to their selling point? And then, as with Lost In Space, came the two killer blows - plot and sentiment."
4737,one of the worst shows of ALL TIME! absolutely no original jokes and they're always a year late. like in 2009 they will finally say something about Michael Vick's dogfights.

4743,"I am a former Special Operations soldier with 14 years in the ""lifestyle""<n>This movie was totally totally totally unreal and obviously written by someone that did very little research into life in the Army, in combat or at a team or platoon level"
4744,"I really wanted to like this movie, but ended up bored and incredulous. The first shot is a camera feed from a robot traveling towards a bomb and is, naturally, shaky. But then the rest of the movie stays in shakycam mode"
4745,"Bigelow is la major macho in her depiction of a tough American hombres stuck in Iraq defusing roadside bombs set by the ruthless, child-killing Arab terrorists."
4746,"This is not a good movie, and if it wins any awards at all, it's a further reflection of why ""La La land"" is so named"

4750,"What a pile of steaming poo this movie is!! Does anyone know the address of the director so I can get my five dollars back???? Finally someone bumped ""Stop-loss"" from the 'Worst Iraq War Movie Ever' number one spot"

4753,I'm surprised by the high rating of this film to be honest..really am. All I saw was a slow moving propaganda movie with nothing much to say. (Note to self must check the rating for Platoon on here)
4754,Don't waste your time and money on this movie. It's a waste of your time and money. It's a waste of your money.

4757,Don't waste your time and money on this one. brbrbrbrI just saw this film while deployed overseas and I can say that the overwhelming feeling from the audience was WTF? This movie made no sense
4758,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is one big pathetic, grainy, cliché. I would have laughed out loud, and a lot, but was on a date with an ex-military guy."
4759,"An interesting concept/theme, but not a good story. Good special effects, but not enough to overcome the basic lack of content. Individual performances were good, and special effects were adequate, but not enough to overcome the basic lack of content"
4760,"Don't bother, if you're military trained, don't bother watching. I put it on the DVD with 2 friends wanting to watch a somewhat interesting action / war flick. Why couldn't I just have read the reviews"
4761,"I really wanted to like this movie, but ended up bored and disappointed. I guess as many folks here I really wanted to like this movie, but ended up bored and disappointed."
4762,Why did I keep getting the mental image that this movie was a remake of some old bad Western movie about a cowboy doing 'brave deeds' in the Wild Wild West infected with 'evil' Red Indians?
4763,"It's a good movie, but it's not as good as I expected it to be. It's not as good as I expected it to be."
4764,"One of Bigelow and Boal's best films, but it's not quite as good as they'd like it to be......"
4765,"It's not as good as I thought it would be, but at least it's not as bad as I'd hoped it would be."
4766,This movie is a real thief. It stole some shiny Oscars from Avatar just because politicians wanted another war-hero movie to boost the acceptance (support?) for the wars U.S. is still fighting today.
4767,The worst film i've ever seen in my entire life..........
4768,"The Hurt Locker is a very realistic portrayal of a group of soldier's rotation in Iraq. This film centers around Will James, a reckless soldier who gets his adrenaline fix from taking risks, and defusing bombs."
4769,The worst political war movie I've ever seen. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. 
4770,"It's not too emotional for a drama, not too gripping for a thriller, not too fast for an action. Plus, some moments of the movie are hardly credible."

4776,Lame plot and two-dimensional script made characters look like cardboard cut-outs. I guess you could say it was on par with your typical made for TV drama
4777,Not worth the money and the time to spend. To see a bunch of one-dimensional characters in a plot that lacks originality is not worth the money and the time to...
4778,"Exploitation of the wilds of Canada, but not worth the price of admission.........."
4779,Interesting recreations of some of the most famous Bigfoot sightings.. but not worth the time spent on the actual movie.....
4780,"This is a typical low budget 1970's mess. It's supposed to be a docudrama about a crew hunting Bigfoot through the Pacific Northwest. Every character is a stereotype, from the Native American to the cynical cowboy."
4781,One of the worst films I've ever seen. I can't believe I've never seen it. I can't believe I've never seen it.
4782,"Not as good as ""Rosemary's Baby"" or ""Necromancy"", but not as bad as ""The Devil's Backbone"""

4784,The re-release of the original witching is a waste of time and money - even if it does add some entertainment value to the witching itself!

4786,"I'm not sure what I'm watching, but I'm not sure what I'm going to like. I'm not sure what I'm going to like. I'm not sure what I'm going"
4787,A little too weird for it's own good. Maybe someday they will put out a tape of the outtakes and bloopers from this movie. Now that would really be fun!
4788,"A bit of a mess, but Orson Welles was a mumbler, and the soundtrack was overwhelming. The magic of DVD could let us see both versions on one disc, but re-releasing this movie probably isn't a priority."
4789,"""Necromancy"" doesn't even describe the art of bringing the dead back to life, it's just plain boring and inept!<n>It's a rip-off of ""Rosemary's Baby"""
4790,"Necromancy has major flaws and is just out and out bad. I saw the version on video called Rosemary's Disciples. Yes, I am sure it differs from other versions, but I am not inclined to think that in any way"

4793,What's the deal with the Brady kids?...................
4794,"I'm so angry at both of them for what happened on that show. I don't care that they were different ages, I know age can't stand between love. But Adrianne, you had been together for ONLY SEVEN"
4795,I do not watch much television and came across this show. Reality show? I sure hope this is not for real. I think she sets a bad example of how a person should treat a person they love.
4796,"Adrianne, should really get a life-without Mr. ""Brady"". She nauseates me, and has been one of the main reasons why I know longer tune in to the show"
4797,"I give this marriage 3 years and thats stretching it. Adrianne Curry is fouled mouth, spoiled, controlling, loud, and her bi sexual past makes me laugh. She tells Chris he has an image to protect and must avoid strip clubs"
4798,"I really wanted to like this movie. It has a nice prison setting, conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, a perfectly hideous 80s-touch and it is a directorial effort by actor John Saxon"
4799,"One of John Saxon's best, but it's not a genre flick........."
4800,It's not the worst but it's not the best either. I'll give it credit if you're a fan of low-budget B movies.
4801,One of the worst zombie movies I've ever seen...........
4802,"One of John Saxon's better films, but it's not quite as good as he'd like it to be brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr"
4803,I love John Saxon in anything he's in. The one time he takes over the camera though he directs a movie that should have more aptly been...
4804,"This movie is a dog, from start to finish, and it's dull and wooden with nothing much going for it. If one watched to the end they may well become a zombie themselves, so don't risk it"
4805,Why watch this? I love John Saxon as I do. Also if you dig John Saxon as I do. Also if you watch this you will love it.
4806,"It's a ""Phantasm"" movie with very little gore, nudity, and quadruple-barrel shot guns. Need I say more?"
4807,Phantasm III.....erm.....terrible.brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
4808,"The Tall Man wins this one, but it's not quite as good as the first two. But it's still a good ending for the series."
4809,"The original Phantasm had such wonderful ambiance and mystery. Like many 70s horror flicks, it looked and felt like some creepy, unfinished documentary. Phantasm II, from the late 80s, pumped up the action, but maintained"
4810,"""Phantasm"" of 1979 was a highly atmospheric, creepy, scary and very original Horror flick, and, in one word, cult. The first sequel of 1988 was gory, witty, action-packed and highly entertaining."
4811,"Not as good as Phantasm II, but still worth a watch. A.M. Baldwin is back as Mike, but not as good as LeGros as in Phantasm II."
4812,"Not as good as the first, but not as bad as the 2nd, either......."
4813,"This is the worst horror movie I have ever seen in my life, and I don't care if you're a fan of the Phantasm series or not."

4815,"Beautiful, but ruined with a bad selection of the actors. The main character is a loser and his woman friend and his friend upset viewers. Apart from the first episode all the other become more boring and boring."
4816,Don't watch this movie if you don't want to watch this movie. Don't watch this movie. Don't watch this movie. Don't watch this movie. Don't watch this movie. Don't

4818,One of the worst propaganda films I've ever seen. Disappointing. Disappointing. Disappointing. Disappointing......
4819,I think this cartoon is one of the worst cartoons I have ever watched. I would recommend this cartoon to people who are under 5. Now I am other 5 and I would rather do my homework than watch it.
4820,Cartoon Network used to be great. One of the shows I liked was Hamtaro. It did manage to be interesting and imaginative in its approach to children programming. The show (Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends) is like putting 20 spoons
4821,This is the worst show I have seen in years. I believe that it should be taken off of T.V. because of its retardedness. (even though I never watch it because it is SOOOOO poor)
4822,"Too bad it wasn't written well. Too bad it wasn't written well. Casting Sidney Poitier as the FBI agent was a good idea, and he did an outstanding job. Tom Berenger, on the other hand, only"
4823,"It's not Poitier's best, it's not Berenger's best, and it's not even his best movie. I'd give it 3/10."
4824,"What a complete waste of time. The movie starts as a clone of the Saw series, but with even worse acting. Melissa Joan Hart is absolutely horrible. The ending is ridiculous and the story contains no twists, not plot surprises and just a"
4825,"Poorly done and not worth watching. The ending was one of the worse (if not the worst) I've ever seen. The actors did a decent job, especially given the garbage lines and motivation they had to work with."
4826,"a very good movie, but the 10 last seconds destroyed it : ) : ) : ) : ) : )"
4827,Is this a comedy? Is this a horror movie? Is this a horror movie? Is this a horror movie? Is this a horror movie? Is this a horror movie? Is this a horror movie?
4828,"Don't waste your time on this film. It could have been good, but the ending was one of the lamest I've ever seen."
4829,"I wanted to like this film, yes its a SAW, blah blah blah ripoff but I like those films. If done well this had all the ingredients of being a good, not brilliant, but good film....unfortunately those ingredients had"
4830,This movie stunk from start to finish. It was hard to watch because I used to watch Clarissa Explains It All every day on Nickelodeon. I LOVED her. Then the next thing I found she did a spread in Maxim and she was
4831,"Good movie, bad script, bad acting, and bad ending... but still watchable........"
4832,"Not as good as the first, but still a good movie for those who like a good plot........."
4833,a waste of your time... ugh.. there is not anything remotely good about this movie... ugh.. the chick is not hot..
4834,Unsatisfactory Remake of a Classic Thriller masquerading as a Thriller masquerading as a Thriller masquerading as a Thriller masquerading as a Thriller masquerading as a Thriller masquerading as a Thriller masquerading as a Thriller masquerading
4835,One of the worst films I've ever seen in my entire life.........
4836,"I found this ""revisioning"" of a great play and worthy 1972 film, a horrible movie experience. If I can save someone from watching it, I will have done a good thing."
4837,The worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I've never seen a movie like this before. I've never seen anything like it.
4838,"Pinter's adaptation of Schaeffer's classic is great, but the rest of the script just doesn't do it for me.<n>Caine and Law are great, but the rest of the script just doesn't"
4839,"An inane remake of Shaffer's classic play, with Caine as the second lead in the marvelous 1972 film. What's next -- ALFIE II, or SON OF THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING?"
4840,"This is a Michael Caine vanity piece, but let's face it, Caine is no Olivier. Not only can he not fill Larry's shoes, he couldn't even fill his bathroom slippers"
4841,"One of the worst remakes I've seen in a long time, but I'm glad it's not as bad as it could have been"
4842,"Sleuth isn't awful, but it seems to be more a movie for critics than for the audience. Sleuth (1972) is still a masterpiece and much more entertaining than Sleuth"
4843,"A remake of the superb 1972 movie of the stage play, nicely casting Caine as the nemesis of his character from the first movie. But doing nothing else nicely at all."
4844,I thought the film was good in parts.the start was exciting.the camera angles in the first 30 minutes of the film were strange and i did not like it coz the were they not covering the actors entirely.
4845,"I loved the original. It was brilliant and always will be. Strangely though, I actually looked forward to seeing the re-make. I was really enjoying it to begin with."
4846,"One of Murnau's best, but it's not quite as good as he'd like it to be...."
4847,This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life.. I don't know what I'm going to say about it..
4848,This movie is a waste of time and money. It's a waste of time and money. It's a waste of time. It's a waste of time. It's a waste of time.
4849,"Not as good as Mu Lan, but not as bad as the other Disney shows. I'd give it a 2/10. I'd give it a 2/10."
4850,"If you're 10 or under, you'll enjoy this movie, but if you're 11 or older, you'll be disappointed too."
4851,"This movie needs a lot of work to be a true depiction of China's history, culture, and religion. It's westernized and untrue to the idea of cooperation and harmony."
4852,"I thought this movie was terrible. I'm Chinese, so I thought everything was totally wrong. The only thing right about Chinese history in the movie was when Wendy's mother explained to her husband about the statues that guarded ShiHuangDi"
4853,"Not that bad, but it's not what you'd expect from a movie about ""the great evil"" and ""the power within"" women."
4854,Don't waste your time and money on this film. It's a waste of your time and money. Don't waste your time and money on this film. It's a waste of your money.
4855,"Worst DCOM I have seen. Ever. Well, maybe not as bad as Smart House. This was just bad. The acting and story was fine, but the effects SUCKED!"
4856,"""BENDY POO: PROM COURIER"" is the worst DCOM I've ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4857,This is the worst DCOM I've ever seen. I've never seen anything like it......
4858,"Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior has a very good, strong plot but is ruined by cheesy details throughout the movie. I am a younger teenager and didn't enjoy this movie very much."
4859,"I'm so insulted by this movie, it's not even funny... And I thought ""Mulan"" was unbelievable! I never figured they'd do something so stereotypical yet so off"
4860,"It's time to see Azumi as an assassin, but it's not quite as good as Azumi 1 and it's not quite as good as Azumi 2"
4861,"Azumi 2 is not as good as Azumi 1, but it's better than Azumi 1!......."
4862,"Not as good as ""Azumi"", but not as bad as ""Azumi"", but not as bad as ""Azumi"", either."
4863,"The movie deserves 2/10. 1.5 stars for the girl, (I'm sorry I'm biased, i think pretty girl is the only highlight of the movies), and 0.5 for the fact that it is shorter than Azumi 1"
4864,"One of the worst movies I've seen..i mean come on, how predictable was the big battle at the end.....brbrsome scenes were so bad it was comical...like Sorbo getting the horse and riding at"
4865,"I can enjoy a guilty pleasure vigilante flick, but this is just bad. And not bad in a way you might enjoy seeing MST3K make fun of it. It's just nauseatingly bad like you can't find anything"
4866,"If you liked Les Visiteurs, you'll like this sequel. If you didn't like Les Visiteurs, you'll like this sequel."
4867,"It's a success story because the movie reaches its goal : being seen by thousands. But it fails at making them laugh...brériebrThe main interest of this film is the landscapes. A movie for youngsters, let"
4868,This film is so bad and gets worse in every imaginable fashion. Its not just the poor acting and script nor is it the lame and perverse time one wastes on watching it.
4869,"If you want to learn how to edit a movie, you'll have to watch this movie! But if you want to waste your time, you'll have to watch this movie!"
4870,"""The visitors"" was an enormous hit in France. So, this sequence ranks among the worst ones ever made. So, what's the interest of this movie otherwise commercial?"

4874,What's wrong with being faithful to the text? What's wrong with being faithful to the text? What's wrong with being faithful to the text?
4875,The CGI monsters were reasonable well animated but was implemented in the worst possible way. The fight scenes weren't even fights it was just one shot of an actor then one shot of monster with very interaction at all. When the monster did interact
4876,"Why can't anyone make a decent film out of a legendary tale? This is the second adaptation of ""Beowulf"" I've been disappointed with in a year. But I have to say, the previous version..."
4877,"This movie lost me with the crossbow RPG (rocket-propelled grenade). It was like someone cut and pasted a scene from Robocop. I half expected Beowulf to say, ""I LIKE IT!"""
4878,"""Grendel"" looks like it was shot on a tiny budget and the CG effects are terrible. Like I said, this movie is absolutely needless."
4879,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen it more than once......"
4880,"Not as good as ""Beowulf & Grendel,"" but not as bad as ""Kingdom of Heaven"" or ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies"
4881,"This movie is not going to help. May the saints preserve us, because this movie is not going to help.brbr. Someone with access needs to e-mail Mel Gibson and tell him we need a faithful production of Beowulf"

4885,"Good Folks, I stumbled on this film on evening while I was grading papers. My academic specialty is Anglo-Saxon literature, and I can say that no one has ever done the genre the honor it deserves."
4886,"Not as bad as some of the other trash the Sci-Fi Channel has produced, but it still has potential to be a lot better. The only thing that works is the dialogue, which is still wooden here and there."
4887,Very disappointing and a complete waste of time. brbr Typical Hollywood to get this so wrong. brbr Very disappointing and a complete waste of time. brbr
4888,Not as accurate as I expected

4901,I wish I had more hands so I could give this show FOUR THUMBS DOWN. It squeezes by my rating with a 2 out of 10 simply because it uses the Batman name. Warner Bros...rethink this!
4902,"What the hell are they doing to mess with the winning formula? The original animation was dark and brooding, exactly the way Batman was intended to be. WB had to mess this up with some tripe Batman of the Future. Now they produce"

5615,This movie was portrayed in the trailer as a comedy. It is an extreme tragedy. I hated it. I think if they want to make a movie like this than they should be man enough to reflect the true intentions of the movie in the
5616,Not as good as the previews would have us believe but it's still a good movie...if you put the real Lindsay Lohan aside......
5617,"I don't know anyone that has gone to see ANY of Lindsay's recent movies. I rather imagine 2007 will be the high water mark in her movie making career, until she cleans up her act."
5618,"I'm only rating this film as a 3 out of pity because it attempts to be worthwhile. I love to praise a great movie and I'm not biased toward ""male"" movies. Legally blonde was an excellent film."

5622,"Not Rodney Dangerfield's last film, but still not Oscar-worthy........."
5623,"Put a DVD of this flick in a time capsule, and it will definitely illustrate for future generations a perfect example of one which warrants the minimal rating on a 1-to-10-star scale"

5626,What happened to the Disney of the 50's and 60's? This movie is crap. The sad thing is that I suspect Disney in their arrogance does not even know when a movie is good or bad.

5631,One of the worst remakes I've ever seen...........
5632,"This is the third parody of the scary movies and hopefully the last. This time the spoof is mainly on The Ring, Signs and 8 Mile for some weird reason. In my opinion this movie was very pointless and unnecessary and not even funny."

5670,"A low-budget ""Hostel"" rip-off with the redeeming use of gratuitous sex, almost constant during the first half of the film. So, basically, it IS just a low-budget ""Hostel"" rip-off with"

5679,It's the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie. But the U.S. propaganda thrown in your face proves--disappointingly--that it's the work of humans.

5681,This is to Indiana Jones what Speed 2 is to Speed. A reasonable cast battles against a puerile script and loses badly. National Treasure aims for Dan Brown but hits the same intellectual level as an episode of Scooby Doo sans the humour.
5682,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long, long time........."
5683,It's just not realistic. People like me will tear this movie apart. It's just not realistic. The Plot is sooooooo predictable. You can anticipate everything that happens convientantly...
5684,"I really did expect something more from this film. Maybe something along the lines of 'Conspiracy Theory'. Now I'm wondering, why did they bother? But instead of an absorbing action cum mystery drama I was caught up in"
5685,"This movie is like the thousand ""cat and mouse"" movies that preceded it. (The following may look like a spoiler, but it really just describes a large class of movies)"
5686,"""National Treasure"" isn't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork of tired old bits from other movies. The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of."

5689,What a disappointment! I hated the mummy but this one was even worse! It was very tiring and unbelievable and at a certain point I found myself sighing and yawning all the time. I can't believe that people actually liked this movie

5691,One of the worst films I've ever seen...........
5692,I'm so glad i didn't have to pay money to see this horrible movie. it was like a history nut went on a coke binge!
5693,I almost drowned in CHEESE watching this movie. In fact I could not even finish it. I want my money back. Good thing I keep a bowl of lemons in the fridge. Just in case. They should of gave Nic Cage a hat
5694,"This is the most elementary sort of traditional ghost story, not even enlivened to any great extent by the use of Irish locations. This is yet more proof, if any more were needed, that the Academy Awards have never been any guarantee of merit"

5712,I was so disturbed by the real footage at the beginning of the film that I felt sick to my stomach and ended up shutting the movie off. How any can give this film more than a rating of 1 baffles me
5713,"One of the worst, if not the worst, movie I've ever nearly seen. (I couldn't watch it all the way through.)"
5714,"""Seed"" is torture porn...no doubt about it. But, strangely, Uwe Boll has written, produced, and directed a more polished film than any other he has made in recent memory."
5715,This movie should be removed from the market. I have contacted Netflix and other resources to collaborate getting this movie off the market!!brbrThis movie should be removed from the public. The person who made this movie needs psychological help.
5716,"""Seed"" is nothing more than a snuff film. And he said this is based on true events because if a person survives the electric chair after being shocked three times, they will be set free. This is an urban legend, and it"

5719,I am ashamed to have this movie in my collection. The most redeeming factor to owning the DVD is the short film in the bonus features. My vote for this movie is a big fat ZERO

5721,"The only reason ""The Norliss Tapes"" deserves ANY stars is the presence of Angie Dickinson in the cast. Other than getting to see Angie Baby in a pre-""Police Woman"" performance, there's nothing else worth seeing here"

5725,"One of Alex Cox's better films, but it's not as good as he's made it out to be.<n>The plot goes through hoola-hoops to keep things so off-beat it might as well"
5726,"Disappointing, but not the worst of Cox's films. Worth a look but ultimately disappointing. Worth a look but ultimately disappointing. Worth a look but ultimately disappointing."
5727,"What's with the whole 1984ish police torture stuff? It was totally superfluous and had nothing to do with the actual events of the story. Cox added a lot of things, in fact, that he apparently thought would be really cool,"

5731,Tritter's vindictiveness cuts into the real hospital story and makes everyone angry at police authority. It needs to have a more caring nature instead of the vindictiveness to everyone at the hospital.
5732,A disappointing end to a season that started so well...brbrIts almost as if the corporate execs didn't like the low key down note ending and wanted to jazz it up. They failed and rather spoilt everything.

5744,One of the worst propaganda programs ever produced in the U.S. by the Fox News Network......

5758,"I'm quite perplexed about everything. The title, the story and the motivation. Well, this wooden character drama is more a enigmatically moody romance bound-story of alienation, possession and dependence twisted into a complicatedly passionate relationship"

5945,Not as bad as I thought it was going to be. Don't get me wrong as it certainly isn't great either. The script by Barry Pearson tries a stab at satire with the brain washing and mind control by T.V
5946,"One of the worst 80's horror movies I've seen in a long, long time......."
5947,"It's a Canadian horror flick, but it's not as bad as some of the other ones I've seen......."
5948,One of the weakest films in the series. Its a huge let down after the classic Tarzan and His Mate which is possibly the best film in the series.

5957,This movie is pretty bad..but if you like a brainless flick that offer nothing but just good action scene then watch this movie. Do not expect nothing more that just that.

5982,What exactly was going on during World War 11 in New Zealand when American forces were there?brbrThis awful story of 4 sisters was really pathetic to view. Can you imagine casting Joan Fontaine as the older sister to Sandra Dee?
5983,"Unusual setting for an American wartime movie, New Zealand. Unusual subject matter, four sisters and their relationships with American soldiers. Unusual that I could be bothered to write a review of such a poor film, give it a miss!"

5989,This movie is truly boring. It was banned in Chinese cinema and i can see why. It's not because it's critical of the communist regime but simply because the movie is of such low quality. I would never want to pay
5990,This is a film for fourteen year olds who have been let out on their own for the first time. Don't dare to watch it with your kids.
5991,One of the worst films I have ever seen. I swit ched off after ten minutes. I switched it off after ten minutes. I find it hard to believe how even a twelve year-old boy could find this funny.
5992,The Spy Who Shagged Me is an over-hyped sequel to IMOM. It's an over-hyped sequel. It's an over-hyped sequel. It's an over-hyped sequel. It's an over
5993,"This film is not even worth walking to the movie theatre. No jokes, but stupid and boring laughing on repeated disgusting stuff. The music and the girls are great, unfortunately you have to watch the whole movie to enjoy them."
5994,One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time..........
5995,A little better than the first one. It still relies on a lot of its humor which basically keeps saying that the old Bond movies were not realistic. That wears thin after so many parodies.
5996,One of the worst films I've ever seen! This has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen! This has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen!
5997,"I wish I had the time I spent watching this movie back. The balloon scene was stupid, the Mormon jokes are really old, the soundtrack sucked, I saw no chemistry between the two leads..most noted was Del ""I'm"

6003,"One Missed Call isn't bad, but it's not Miike's best work yet......"

6009,"It's not a bad film, but it's at least half-an-hour longer than it should be, with its absurd 110 minutes length. Compared to many other Japanese horror films, OMC lacks atmosphere and excitement."

6012,"This norwegian movie is so crap, the actors can not act cause they seems to be reading from a book and the story is so (wannabe) hollywood..the only actor who did a ok job was Haavard"
6013,"It's not too bad, but it's not great either. brbrIt's not really a bad movie, and the ending did feel quite good. Just don't expect anything out of the ordinary."
6014,"It's just simply not funny. Not once, not ever. But the thing is... We THINK its funny. Because we're used to norwegian movies to be funny. Especially with a cast like this with a few really"

6024,One of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. I laughed so hard I almost choked to death. I missed this in theaters. It's a good reason because I would have been kicked out due to the laughing I broke into

6033,One of the worst FILMS ever made. For that matter one of the worst FILMS ever made. Slog through jungle looking areas for 10 minutes or so. Have Bo go somewhere and strip.
6034,This is the best film the Derek couple has ever made and if you think this is a recommendation then you haven't seen any of the others. But it has a few things going for it.

6037,One of the most ill-advised remakes of a classic in film history........

6046,"I screamed my head off. I remember it being incredibly bloody and it made me angry. I watched it again on tv a few years ago. Big mistake -- the acting is wooden, the plot non-existent and the movie lacks merit unless"
6047,This is a soft-porno for schoolboys. Undressing Bo Derek and painting her with color - nice. But then they should named the film Undressing Bo and painting her.

6051,"Tarzan the Ape Man is a remake of the 1932 film of the same time, and like that earlier film, it has little resemblance to Burroughs' literary character. But while the 1932 Tarzan was reduced to ""Tarzan - Jane"" speech,"

6055,"""Fungicide"" is the worst ""film"" I've ever seen - and I'm not talking about ""Citizen Kane"" or anything."
6056,"I'm surprised by the positive votes that this film has received. The movie just drags along its 81 minute life span, and the audience has to suffer the whole way through."
6057,"Charlie Spradling dancing in a strip club. Beyond that, it features a truly bad script with dull, unrealistic dialogue. That it got as many positive votes suggests some people may be joking."
6058,"Not as good as Dance of the Damned, but not as bad as Corman's other films, either :            "
6059,"Poorly written, overacted, and poorly directed. The story obviously had potential, but that story is nowhere present in this film. Clara Barton was a human being. She had passions, desires, love, pain, embarrassment, weakness,"

6079,"'Maladolescenza' has the air of a dark fairy tale, with its child protagonists, forest setting, and the discovery of a castle's ruins. Yet at its core, the film is essentially an unusual psychosexual study"

6087,"DeNiro is a master, Snipes is good, Barkin's a little out of place.. but it could have been so much better!"
6088,"The Fan was a disappointment. It felt like as if I was watching Taxi Driver, except Taxi Driver was much better than this. It seemed like the filmmakers wanted us to root for Robert Deniro's character 100 percent."

6098,"Carpenter needs to learn a thing or two about pacing and decent, plausible dialog. He needs to trim back that overdone, over-simplified musical score of his (or his son's) and advance the action a little bit."
6099,Not the worst but it wasn't that great. I'm not really pro-choice but I wanted the choice to kill this episode. I was laughing when I saw the baby come out and it went into the corner.

6117,"I'm still under the influence of this movie, having just watched it, and the unique effect this has renders one incapable of coherent, reasoned criticism. That is not a compliment. It isn't the narcotic effect of a truly hypnotic"
6118,"A very sensitive study about three women, but nothing else happens in this movie. As times goes on, you discover that the director Dorothée Van Den Berghe only wants to develop a psychological portrait of the three women."

6161,"Not a great film, but a good learning tool for the amateur film maker. I'm sure this was a great learning tool for them. I wish them luck in the future, and hope they can improve their film making."
6162,"Not a very good movie but according to the info it's pretty accurate in depicting torture techniques. The purpose of the film was to show the brutality of the NK POW camps and that's done effectively enough, with surprising frankness for"

6180,Well done Al Gore! You have become the first person to have made 1 Billion dollars of the global warming lie! Just like all the other man made fable's in the world this one is up there with the best lies to have sucked
6181,Goebbels could have pulled off a propaganda stunt like what Gore has done with this complete piece of fiction. This is a study in how numbers and statistics can be spun to say whatever you have...
6182,"Outrageously trashy karate/horror thriller with loads of graphically gory violence and gratuitous nudity, and a thoroughly preposterous and bizarre ""plot"""

6189,Don't take anything about this movie to be accurate. The name Parsons in the title and stealing of his body is just used as springboard for a low budget chase movie.
6190,"What could have been clever and moving was campy. It was devoid of the music that made Gram and had more filler than cheap dog food. I am tempted to steal every copy of Grand Theft Parsons, head out to the desert and burn"

6206,"Controversial, but not quite as good as it could have been.<n>The audience's reaction to it was more interesting than the film itself."
6207,"One word for this film. Appalling. The director clearly has talent but like his character Robert Carmichael he throws it all away.brbrCarmichael has potential, but like Cray he can't be bothered to use it"
6208,"An emotional rape on the viewer. The movie supposedly caused quite a stir among the critics in Cannes, but for me the final scene was just a pathetic attempt for a newbie director to get himself noticed. Hardly a voice in the discussion on"

6210,What on earth is the school film project all about? And what on earth is the school film project all about? The use of newsreel during the climactic murder is laughable. These guys obviously think they're intellectuals but are hopelessly out

6219,"The world is cruel like this, and it's not funny. That itself doesn't mean that the movie is bad. Nevertheless I think this a bad movie."
6220,Badly made. Dreadful acting and an ending that the Director appeared to contrive out of nowhere as the film had frankly been nothing short of dull. Shocking that this film is considered for an award at the Gijn Film Festival
6221,"One of the most moronic films in years. (I am not against violence in film. To do it seriously is a hard trick though - people in cinemas cheered Alex in ""Clockwork Orange"" showing how Kubrick's supposed intent was"

6225,Another example of how difficult it is to adapt a novel to the screen.........
6226,The DVD version of this movie was a disaster. The lighting was poor to non-existent and entire scenes were simply excised. We're sending this one back.
6227,"This is the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre I have seen. It is so true to the book, it's like having the novel read aloud to you."
6228,The worst adaptation of one of my favourite novels. By far. The dialogue was horribly clumsy; I could sense no feeling behind the words expressed by the characters. They could just as well have been cited by statues.

6233,This movie makes Peter an elf in Robin Hood costume instead of a human boy in probably-not-Robin-Hood-costume and ignores all the persona features in him that really matter.

6237,"'The Home Front' has little relevance today other than as an historical artefact. Frank Tashlin plays the risqué card more heavily, extended jokes involving strippers and scantily clad dancing girls in place of much effective comic relief."

6295,"Good, but with no one to empathize with, I found it hard to care about what happened to them.brbr My Grade: C-"
6296,Jennifer's Shadow is a dull & predictable modern ghost story. I would imagine will put more people to sleep sooner than scare them. I'm sure most people don't want to sit down & be bored out of their skulls.
6297,"This movie was a little confusing at first, but Faye Dunaway was good. It was about Jennifer Cassi who comes to her twin sisters funeral. She stays at a house that her sister owns and her grandmother(Dunaway) lives at"
6298,"This was a really bad movie. The girl who plays Jennifer is OK, but I think she acts bitchy through the movie, not because she is having her organs ripped out by a raven at night, but because she is thinking of"
6299,"Don't bother. A little prosciutto could go a long way, but all we get is pure ham, particularly from Dunaway. The plot is one of those bumper car episodes..."
6300,Faye Dunaway and Mary Ellen the Grandmother-From-Hell are both pretty lousy....cause they're both pretty lousy. I think the best part of the movie is the horrendously imperial picture of Faye at the top of the stairs
6301,The worst film I've ever seen. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever
6302,"Faye Dunaway, Duilio Marzio, and Nicholas Pauls don't do this movie justice. It's not scary, it's boring."
6303,This is the last time I rent a video without checking in at the reviews. The Limey is directed by Steven Soderbergh who also wrote the truly awful Nightwatch with Ewan Macgregor and directed such trash as Out of Sight
6304,"This film has the look and feel of a Student film project. Yeah, there are some interesting (albeit gimmicky) edits and shots, but the end result was juvenile."
6305,Don't waste your money on this movie. It's a waste of time and money. Don't waste your money on this movie. It's a waste of money. Don't waste your money on this movie.

6309,"Barbara Bouchet is the best thing about this film, but it doesn't have much else to offer......"
6310,Wow this movie sucked big time. I heard this movie expresses the meaning of friendship very well. And with all the internet hype on this movie I figured what could go wrong...
6311,"This is a movie with one voice. The same voice, which comes out of every characters mouth regardless of age or gender. To listen to that voice again I would have to charge at least $150 an hour. And I don't take"

6314,This movie left me feeling jipped out of my time and mental energy. Here was the quintessential Woody Allen film all over again: the neurotic upper-class Manhattanites debating whether or not they will cheat on their spouses.
6315,"I'd laugh if i stumbled across this script in textual form. I would not, however laugh at the points in the film where the director would seem to want me to laugh. Although I am still not altogether sure where these are."
6316,One of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don't think I've ever seen one like this. I don't think I've ever seen one like this.
6317,"Woody Allen has lost his ability to write dialogue or characters that are clearly distinguishable from each other. This is the case with ""Melinda and Melinda,"" where all the characters speak with Allen's generic pseudo-sophistication and"

6321,"The worst Woody Allen movie I've seen in a long, long time - and it's not just because it's a Woody Allen movie."
6322,Not Woody Allen's best but not his worst either...........
6323,"Utterly pretentious nonsense. The material is dull, dull, dull, and most of the cast wouldn't even have made understudies in Allen's earlier films"
6324,I'll still go to any new film Woody may come out with in the future. There's always hope and I'll continue to love and respect The WOODY!!
6325,"This movie stinks! You will want back the two-plus hours it takes to get through it. Sliding Doors, w/ Gwyenth Paltrow and directed by Peter Howit, did what Melinda & Melinda tries to do much MUCH better"
6326,this movie is just an excuse for the writer to make a film out of 2 failed scripts. This movie is just an assembly of characters with cliché tragic or comic attributes the sum total of which is neurotic dialog like only woody Allen could write.
6327,I walked out after half an hour                     
6328,"I'll stick with Sleeper and Bananas for my Woody Allen fix. If I ever come across this on the teevee, I'll turn over and try to find an episode of Quincy instead."

6330,"It's a progressive film for China, but it perpetuates myths about the femininity of gay men. Much is made of Chinese myths in which men take on female roles."
6331,"This is the kind of movie i fear the most. Arrogant and Irresponsible, it presents a sketch of the colombian conflict so cliched and dumb it represents an insult to all Colombian people."
6332,"One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long, long time, and I've seen it a few times too..........."

6343,"Why does this movie fall WELL below standards? Ultimately, the answer lies in the poor, humourless script. A slim/average looking Travolta (looking rather dapper in black I must say, even with a HUGE mullet) and Gross both act"
6344,"I thought this film would be a lot better then it was. It sounded like a spoof off of the spy gener, and the start of it reminded me of Pleasantvil, but this film came up short."
6345,"Don't expect a lot of plausibility, just a little light entertainment........"
6346,"One of the five worst movies I have ever watched. And I'm not exaggerating. In fact, I recommend watching it so you can get the same feeling of incredulity as you might by watching Showgirls"

6358,"A film that could be both entertaining and inspirational to us all, but sadly missed and created a film that only reinforces the idea that to be a young black male in London the only future is violence & tragedy"
6359,The British Film Industry is obsessed with the idea of 'broken Britain' and the idea of 'broken youth'<n>This movie offers nothing new to a long list of British films that are effectively dull and depressing to watch

6363,One of the worst movies I have ever seen. I sat and cringed from the start until the end at the very poor way that this had been put together.
6364,"I agree with the comments from the gentleman from UK. The movie was pretty terrible. All cliché, no real plot. Historical and technical inaccuracies abound. Look up the technical specs on DE 529, or any Everts class Destroyer Escort"
6365,A movie that should have focused on the accomplishments of the men that served on the USS Mason for their triumph in the face of adversity and for the hardships that they endured.
6366,"This is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the United States. (We are still working on it too.) However despite the fact this is true, it's still a movie and this is a movie site."
6367,I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I've given way too much of my life this crap movie. I've given way too much of my life this...
6368,What a waste of time and money. I'm glad I didn't waste my time on this one. I'm glad I didn't waste my time on this one.
6369,"The British 'heritage film' industry is out of control. There's nothing wrong with filming classic novels, but why must they all be filmed by talentless nobodies?"
6370,"This film suffers from a fatal flaw - the lack of charm of the central character/actor. One of the characters describes Richard E Grant's character as ""a whining little turd"" and unfortunately this sums him up perfectly."

6378,I thought it was going to be pretty good...I was right...I thought it could have been better...The acting was OK and the storyline pretty well follows the original but it just didn't seem to hit the mark with me...

6382,This is the worst romantic comedy I have ever seen. Every scene is cringe worthy and the two lead actors are soo annoying. Corey is very dumb and naive and should have never listened to Danny's false promises.
6383,"Not as good as the Twilight Zone episode, but not as bad as Rod Serling's ""Mirror Image"" or Sean Ellis's ""The Broken"""

6388,"What an incredible fall for Sean Ellis. What an incredible fall for Sean Ellis. A new level of boring movie-making, imagine a short story extended to a novel with just descriptions, this is what it is."
6389,"""The Broken"" is an overlong, derivative and dull movie with only a handful of remarkable ideas and memorable sequences. Sean Ellis made a very stylish and elegantly photographed movie, but the story is lackluster and the total absence of logic and explanation"

6393,"It's not a flics movie, it's a rip-off of ""Invasion of the Body-Snatchers"" with Keifer Sutherland's ""Mirror"" and ""The Sixth Sense"""
6394,"this film really tries to hard. if your going to make a horror film, at least give it a reason to believe in to hook the viewer. this doesn't and it just waffle's on with tons of padding to make everything"
6395,Not a slasher or filled with gore. Plenty of broken glass and mirrors in this edgy thriller from France and writer/director Sean Ellis. Kudos if you can figure this one out...it won't be any tighter.
6396,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time, and I've seen it many times before.........."
6397,"""have you even seen the wizard of oz"" was the best part for me! with terrible writing and acting like displayed in this movie it's no wonder so many are taken in by worthless tv reality shows"
6398,The ending was merely one more despicable effort to emasculate men and empower women at their expense. The girl refused to listen to reason and logic and used her passive/aggressive nature to control and impose her will on the guy who ultimately

6424,It could be about a screenwriter intermingled with his own characters. Is it? Maybe. By that I don't mean that Slipstream is ambiguous; I mean that there is no telling. Hopkins's film is an experiment.

6429,This is the worst movie I have ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
6430,"mish-mash of stuff happening for no apparent reason and it's all disconnected. I love movies that make you think, but this movie was just a bunch of ideas thrown together and never really connected."
6431,One of the worst movies that I have seen in my life. Thank you Christian Slater for putting some humor into it. If you hadn't been in this movie I would of been bored out of my mind.
6432,"What's the problem with this movie? It's all about the music, it's all about the music. It's all about the music."
6433,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my 50 years. Please do us all a favor Mr. Hopkins and stick to acting, which you are excellent at, and leave the writing and directing to those who are talented in those areas"

6445,Disney has yet to meet a movie it couldn't make at least two sequels about. And this one was no exception to the people at Disney to give a weak story to receive a quick reward.
6446,"Not as good as the first, but still fun for the whole family........."
6447,"It was nice to see all the familiar characters again, but the story bothered me. We loved Ariel in the first movie- so why is the second one centered around her daughter?"

6455,"Not as good as the original, but not as bad as it could have been........"
6456,"This is a movie that is bad in every imaginable way. Sure we like to know what happened 12 years from the last movie, and it works on some level. But the new characters are just not interesting. Baby Melody is hideously horrible"
6457,Disney goes to the well one too many times as anybody who has seen the original LITTLE MERMAID will feel blatantly ripped off. I guess Disney can only plagiarize itself!
6458,"A good sequel, but not as good as the first one. It could have had a bit more thought. Adequate. Adequate......"
6459,Brando in his last years is looking more like Orson Welles and Free Money is the kind of film Welles would have done looking for financing of his own work
6460,"I still can't believe this movie. They got so much unbelievable things in it, that it's hard to believe anyone wanted to make it."
6461,"The worst of Marlon Brando's career. He doesn't overact. Instead, he simply acts in a bizarre fashion and pokes fun at his..."
6462,This Charles outing is decent but this is a pretty low-key performance. Marlon Brando stands out. There's a subplot with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland that forgets to develop and it hurts the film a little.
6463,Brando's acting is the only thing that makes this movie watchable. The plot is inane and laughable (not comic)... these characters have the humanity of wet cardboard.
6464,"I'm a Brando fan, but I don't think this movie is worth watching. I'm giving it 2 out of 10 because I still think the worst movie ever made was Skidoo."
6465,Don't waste your time with this movie. I have to fill more lines to get this accepted. I have to fill more lines to get this accepted. I'm overdue to do something interesting. Bye. Bye. Bye.

6469,The worst film I've seen in a long time...........
6470,"I guess I've seen worse films, but that may be becuz I'm so jaded by how standard these bad horror movies are. The killer monster thing is really really bad, basically its a guy in some kind of green body"
6471,What can it be said about this disaster? I watched it because it aired on cable. I regret for wasting my time but at least I didn't waste...
6472,"Really a terrible movie. It's to be expected, though. More importantly, there's a very interesting twist regarding Kat's experiments and Wes & Steve that I didn't see coming."
6473,"Big Chill, Big Chill, Big Chill, Big Chill, Big Chill, Big Chill, Big Chill, Big Chill, Big Chill, Big Chill, Big Chill, Big Chill, Big Chill, Big Chill, Big Chill, Big Chill,"
6474,"Chase Masterson is nice to look at and actually can act, though her role in this clunker is a waste. Unfortunately the rest of the cast ranges from bad to mediocre."

6476,"Not as good as CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON, but not as bad as CREATURE FROM THE FOG, but not as bad as CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON"
6477,The worst horror movie i've seen in a long time..........
6478,"The Big Chill with a cast of twenty-somethings whose characters are all unlikable, and an iguana-like man-lizard chasing them around and you have an idea of the herein foolishness"
6479,"Creature Unknown is the right word for this movie. Or maybe it should be called Unknown Movie. This movie is a piece of crap right from the beginning. It has a really stupid ""plot,"" really pathetic ""acting,"" and so-so"
6480,"One of the worst films I've seen in a long time, and I've seen it in a long time, and I've seen it in a long time, and I've seen it in a long time."
6481,"""Monsoon Wedding"" shows India in a very bad light giving wrong notions. It is unjust to discuss only one aspect of the society. Exactly the reason why people ask me, ""When we go to India... can we hire an elephant"
6482,Unjustified and vilified the American people and their level of debate in Educated American Society by very fraudulently and deceptively presenting this ultra-right wing bunch of psychopaths as being representative of American Society
6483,An example of a college student who judges the entire community based on limited contact with a small number of its members. Steven Greenstreet's documentary is a prime example of a disillusioned college student who judges the entire community based on limited contact with

6491,"The worst movie I've seen in a long time. I am a kind person, so I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1. It was without a doubt the worst movie that I've seen in a long time."
6492,"One of the most visually beautiful films I've seen in a while, but the imagery does not make up for the downward spiral of patronizing exposition that makes it unbearable"
6493,"Not the best movie I've ever seen, but it's up there. The producers spent more time on the soundtrack than the editing. It was so loud when the soundtrack was playing and no one was talking and then when Patrica"
6494,"""Tail Joe"" is not the real Joe McCarthy, but it's still a good film. The ""red scare"" is a myth that has been passed down for decades."
6495,"""Tail Gunner Joe"" was a tag given to the Senator which relied upon the ignorance of the public about World War II aircraft. This film was designed to do one thing, destroy the reputation of a complex person."
6496,"Never, ever watch this film if you're looking for truth regarding Sen. McCarthy. Read Ann Coulter's book, ""Treason"" for a better look at the truth about Sen. McCarthy."
6497,The worst film I have ever seen. It may be the worst film I have ever seen. I'm surprised a distributor put their name on it.

6499,"I'm increasingly not liking his style. He seems to find very interesting and varied characters, great personalities to create documentaries for, and then with tongue-in-cheek editing make fun of everything they are about."
6500,"not worth the time, money, or effort to watch................"
6501,"Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control is a fairly interesting documentary. I very much enjoyed the film of one thing with a voice dub over another. It played out excellent and also coincided nicely with the music."
6502,"Sorry, I just didn't find the subject matter as compelling as the filmmaker did. The robot guy and the mole rat guy were pretty interesting, although Morris didn't really tell us much about them."
6503,"An excellent black comedy, but it's not as good as it could have been. Ron Perlman's the star, but he's worth it."
6504,"I laughed out loud at some of the scenes in the terribly clichéd, but still funny, rich-but-screwed-up characters, where the story unravels towards it's final moments."
6505,"""I just viewed this movie last night and I don't think I will ever think the same about any of the actors involved, because this movie will stick in the back of my mind."""
6506,I am amazed with some of the reviews of this film. The only place that seems to tell the truth is RottenTomatoes.com. This film is awful
6507,"not bad, not bad at all, not bad at all, not bad at all, not bad at all, not bad at all, not bad at all!"
6508,Don't waste your time and money on this movie...it's a waste of your time and money...it's a waste of your money...
6509,Don't waste your money on this movie...it's not scary...it's not funny...it's just boring...don't waste your time!
6510,"This was the stupidest movie I have ever seen, it was ridiculous, how can any moron sit there and say that just because a movie makes you jump it is a good movie, that might be the most idiotic thing I have ever heard"
6511,What would you do if you were being pursued by someone you just discovered was a murderer?               
6512,This was the worst movie i've ever seen in my entire life. I saw this movie for free by the way so I don't want this to come across as a rant from a guy that lost 8 bucks on a terrible movie
6513,This is by far the worst piece of cr4p I've ever seen in my life. It barely made sense. It wasn't scary at all (unless you class scary as loud noises and screaming?) Sarah-Michelle Gellar
6514,"Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's not worth your time or money to see it in theaters. I recommend watching a good movie instead."
6515,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long, long time. I can't believe this person liked it. I can't believe that any sane human would like it."
6516,The Return is one of those movies for that niche group of people who like movies that bore and confuse them at the same time. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a lame buisnesswoman who does not kill vampires or get naked at all throughout
6517,"It's not a horror film, it's a supernatural thriller. Too bad it's not the least bit thrilling. It's just plain awful."
6518,"I'm a Buffy fan, but I know crap when I see it. On every level, this film is terrible. Technically, much of the time you don't know where you are in this movie, even within one scene,"
6519,"Don't be fooled by the UPA style--it's not great animation, it's not great story, it's not great animation!"
6520,"I watched this film for 45 minutes and counted 9 mullets. That's a mullet every 5 minutes. Seriously though, this film is living proof that formula works. If it ain't broke, it don't need fix"
6521,"It's an older style of entertainment and has more value as history than as comedy or titillation. Robin Williams has a couple of bits, but he's interchangeable with the other players."
6522,"Horrible, but not as bad as some of Seltzer & Friedberg's other films......."
6523,I'm a Robin Williams fan.......................
6524,"....as to the level of wit on which this comedy operates. Barely even reaching feature length, ""Can I Do It....'Till I Need Glasses"" is a collection of (mostly) dirty jokes."
6525,One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life. I can't even speak for the last 25 minutes of the movie. I can't speak for the last 25 minutes of the movie.
6526,"Can I Do It 'till I Need Glasses? at the very least proves the point that anyone can make a movie. Talent is not a consideration. The target audience must consist of the recently labotimized, and infants who play with"

6528,Mistral's Daughter is an overlong miscast melodrama. The only redeeming quality is the scenery of southern France and the voice of Nana Mascouri singing the theme song.
6529,It's not even fit to be called a movie. :) :P :D I invite everyone to add to my list. :) :P :D
6530,"I don't know what I'm going to say about this movie, but I don't think I'll give it a 5 star rating!"
6531,It''s kind of fun to watch until a tough New York City-type woman enters the picture and takes over. That ruined the film for me.
6532,The worst movie I've seen all year............
6533,I think this would have been a much better film if the Cajuns had been portrayed in a more believable light. I have never heard the people I grew up around talk like these folks did.
6534,"A horrible rip-off of ""Of Mice and Men"" and should be sued by the book's author and publisher for ruining the original story.."
6535,This is one of the weakest soft porn films around. I can't believe somebody wrote this stupid story before making some changes. The guy Mike is a major wimp and moron I can't believe he didn't want to take

6540,"""Niki ardelean"" comes too late. We already have enough of this and we want something new. It should be the first day of romanian movie not the final song. Maybe younger directors should make the move."
6541,"an ordinary funeral.. and it insists so hard on this ordinary funeral feel that i lost interest within 5 minutes of watching, and started skipping scenes.."
6542,I saw this movie twice. I can't believe Pintilie made such a fantasy movie. I see the events are happening in the same period with the incident from 11 September.
6543,"I find it rather useless to comment on this ""movie"" for the simplest reason that it has nothing to comment upon.It's similar to a rotten egg which has nothing good to show to the world excerpt for the fact that it is"
6544,Lucian Pintilie gets worse every time he makes a movie.<n>Niki and Flo (2003) is a depressing stab at the camera. It's unfortunate that from the many movies that are made yearly in Romania...

6546,"They should have named this movie...Blonde women that needed to get their roots colored. Also the main character, geeze, the too tight sweaters. Thought the guy did a good job though."
6547,"One of the worst, least natural acting performances I've ever seen. Which is perhaps not surprising given the clunky, lame dialog given to the one note characters. Add to that the cheap production values and you've got a movie that"

6555,"If the scale went negative I would be happier. Seeing Sushmita Sen was nice, and Nisha Kothari has a bright future but the producer and the director ruined any and all enjoyment in this story"

6559,This film was absolutely...ugh i can't find the word oh wait... crap! I mean when it started i was like yeah this looks good and then after it was so boring. I nearly fell asleep and it had nothing to do
6560,"Please don't waste your money and time on this movie. I think watching Aap Ka Surror (which I thought was the worst movie possible) would be a better idea than to see this horrible package of stupid characters, bad"
6561,"Don't waste your time, money or your money. This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Don't waste your time, money or your money."
6562,The remake of a classic movie is a waste of time and money.brbrI wouldn't watch the movie even if someone paid me the cost of the tickets or even gave me a free burger with it.

6570,Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag doesn't come anywhere close to the real Sholay. It does not leave a lasting impression on a viewer. Ram Gopal Varma fails to create chemistry between the characters.

6572,Ram Gopal Verma's version of Sholay is a spoof.<n>Babban is more intelligent than the auto driver Ghungroo.<n>Jai is composed and serious. Prashant Raj is better than the others.

6582,An excellent way to introduce children to the pleasures of classic L&H. Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain acquit themselves reasonably as the comedy duo and there's a reasonably good supporting cast.

6589,This film could very well be the worst film I have ever seen and should be pulled off the shelf and locked away forever. The real Laurel & Hardy are surly spinning in their graves at such a bad imitation.

6595,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time, but it's better than the other ones I've seen in the past."
6596,"It's nothing new and it shamelessly steals ideas, but if you can look past that it delivers some nasty chills. A standard effort all round I guess, but still it's equally missable."
6597,"If you appreciate the renaissance in Asian horror, don't bother with Gawi. The film scarcely deserves mention alongside A-list work such as Ringu, A Tale of Two Sisters, Cure, and Ju-On"
6598,"Take The High Ground was not anything like I remember basic training.brbrBut one has to remember at the time this was post Korea which ended in a stalemate, but it was a conventional war as we knew them."
6599,"Nothing more than a sick piece of crap! Excuse the language, but there aren't any decent words to describe it! Excuse the language, but there aren't any decent words to describe it!"
6600,"Interesting idea and storyline which didn't quite work. I didn't really know who to root for in the movie, Taye Diggs looked bored as the detective, the rest of the characters seem so one-dimensional and unpleasant."
6601,"It's not the worst movie in the world, but it's not the best either. Depends on who you're talking about."
6602,"""New Best Friend"" is a waste of time...it's a waste of time. Skip this movie...it's a waste of time."
6603,"Not very interesting teen whodunit saved from being a turkey from some decent performances. The main cast consisting of Taye Diggs, Mia Kirshner, Dominique Swain and surprisingly Meredith Monroe are all good but the story is not very original"
6604,"""New Best Friend"" suffers more than most from the teen movie curse of a cast too old to be portraying undergraduate students. It almost works for the 26 year-old Kirshner when she plays the mousy version of Alicia but"
6605,"Unentertaining, uninvolving hybrid of ""Cruel Intentions"" and ""Wild Things"", but it isn't nearly as good as either of those trash min-classics"
6606,Why do we care? A mess of flashbacks in this mess of a movie featuring a handful of one-hit wonders and B-flick divas which begs the question...Why do we care?

6611,"""All About Lane"" should be changed from ""Only the Brave"" to ""All About Lane"", not ""Only the Brave""... and Gina Hiraizumi should never have been given a speaking role in this film."
6612,"It's a shame, as I really wanted to love this film but couldn't expect to. Chase sports no glasses or mustache--and looks very little like you'd look at him from the mid-1920s on."
6613,"I've never found Charley Chase very funny, even though his on-screen character sometimes reminds me of John Cleese. (Charley Chase also reminds me of gowky Hen Broon from Scotland's 'Sunday Post' comics"

6618,This movie is chilling reminder of Bollywood being just a parasite of Hollywood. Bollywood must move out of Hollywood's shadow if it needs to be taken seriously.
6619,"One of the worst movies i have seen to date, the best part was Christian J. Meoli ""Leonard"" attempting to act jumping up and down outside the bar, kind-of like i wanted to do on the DVD"
6620,"It's a bit too light in the laughs department. The Eskimo isn't really that great of a foil for Bugs and I just seen a lot better Bugs Bunny cartoons frankly, even other shorts..."

6623,"""Shadrach"" was not my favorite type of movie. I found it overly sentimental and the acting was below par. Harvey Keitel and Andie MacDowell were good but some of the other actors weren't at all believable"
6624,This movie's plot and premise totally without credibility. To believe that class and racial biases would be so easily and comfortably suspended would only come from someone totally unfamiliar with the ante-bellum south. Totally absurd!!!
6625,No place to go but up after watching this one. It was pointless and vulgar. Harvey Keitel's script must have been easy to write -- just make two out every three words a curse word.
6626,"They spelled it BRAIN in the credits, not BRIAN. I paid 99 cents for this. I could have bought 3 cans of cat food and watched my cat's face as he emoted more excitement."
6627,Not a Michelle Pffeifer fan but she was the only actor worth watching in this film and even in 1983 she was a decent actress. Overall though unless you are a fan of hers avoid this as it is very routine.

6630,"""Cyborg 3: The Recycler"" is the third (& last so far) entry in the CYBORG trilogy. The film falls into the same trap that so many low-budget sci-fi action films fall victim to."
6631,Cyborg 3 does manage to be better than the other two entries but it still is a largely dull feature. The problem this time is that the ideas with potential are never used well.
6632,A study in bad. A study in bad. A study in bad. A study in bad. A study in bad. A study in bad. A study in bad. A study in bad. A study in bad.

6863,Van Damme does the same old same old rubbish time after time. Poo knickers fight scenes as per usually. The only thing this loser left out was the Russians normally end up being killed in the end.

6976,Oh God..what an idiotic movie!Incredibly cheap with fake special effects(the creature is played by one guy in lame costume)and stupid plot.All dialogues are unbelievably bad and these actors(HA!HA!HA!HA!
6977,"Blue monkey is mentioned in the film but not in any way that makes any possible sense. At one point,some kids are wandering thru the deeper levels, exploring."
6978,Don't get your hopes up for an intelligent screenplay. This isn't a horror movie. It's just another 80's B-cinema flick.
6979,"It's not bad, but it's not as bad as it seems. I'm not sure why this movie is called Blue Monkey, because there is nothing in this movie to do with monkey. But come on people, what"
6980,"BOY does this thing suck. There isn't one original line, thought, shot, or effect from brainless opening sequence to brainless close"
6981,"It's a movie with a message, that message is beat kids and things like this won't happen. Things like what you ask? Now, as promised... Blue Monkey... has nothing Blue in it nor any Simian of any"
6982,"Invasion of the BodySuckers is a pretty boring horror movie!!! I give this movie 2/10!!!! Horror fans don't really need to track this rare movie down, you wont be missing much trust me!!!"
6983,"Not as good as the Alien movies, but not as bad as some of the other horror films I've seen, either...."
6984,Oh God..what an idiotic movie!Incredibly cheap with fake special effects(the creature is played by one guy in lame costume)and stupid plot.All dialogues are unbelievably bad and these actors(HA!HA!HA!HA!
6985,"This movie is a mess, but at least it's not pretentious. The box art for the video markets it as a ""fun"" to 1950s giant bug movies. In reality, it's a transparent bargain basement ripoff of"
6986,"This was the worst MTV Movie Awards EVER!!! I barely laughed, none of the presenters were funny, the hosts really sucked, and the parodies weren't so great either. Why can't we go back to the good olden days"
6987,"This year's MTV Movie Awards were simply horrible. Nothing was coherrent, humorous, or entertaining. Justin Timberlake should stick to singing and dancing; he sure as hell can't act."
6988,The Japanese have always had incredible ambitions in their fantasy movies. They have always been ready to destroy cities by huge plastic monsters coming from outer space and elsewhere.
6989,"It was awful, very baldy played (but some of the few leading roles), the jokes are dumb and absolutely not funny... I won't talk more about this movie, except for one little piece of advice..."
6990,"One of the worst french films I've seen in a long time.brbrIt has to be one of the worst french films I've seen in a long time (actually along with Brotherwood of the Wolves, 2"
6991,"This ""movie"" is an insult to the real french actors participating in this farcical piece of junk. It starts from a concept successfully used in French comedies..."
6992,"This film is supposed to be funny, it's not, not a single laugh in the theatre( perhaps for josé garcia and gérard Depardieu )"
6993,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen! Don't waste your time watching this! Good actors, but extremely bad screenplay and dialogues. Hope there'll be no Blanche 2 :-) Avoid this movie by all means!"
6994,"Avoid this one, unless you want to watch an expensive but badly made movie. Example? The sound is good but the dialogue is not clear - a cardinal sin in a French film."
6995,A woman sucker-punches a man and the man does nothing but cower. So the new (female) Starbuck immediately tainted the plot before it even got off the ground (no pun intended)
6996,"It's a soap opera with some CGI thrown-in. This is not science fiction aside from the original premise. If you like trendy, edgy, dodgy, jumpy editor-on-crack camera work, this show might be for"
6997,"It was better then the first one, but it's not a good one either......."
6998,"One of the most derivitive of science fiction endeavors in a long time. It borrows liberally from ST:TNG, ST:DS9, Babylon 5, and even Battlefield Earth."
6999,"The most horrible retelling of a great series. It should not have been named Battlestar Galactica, because it's only the same in name alone. Too many changes to just have changes."
7000,"Don't you just hate it when you order steak but the restaurant gives you chicken?brbrSuch is how I felt watching this so-called ""Battlestar Galactica"""
7001,"The Ron Moore mini-series is no Battlestar Galactica. It's a new production, inspired by Battlestar Galactica. It doesn't take place in the Galactica universe, with the same places and jargon and technology."
7002,"This is a movie that deals in nasty, threadbare stereotypes instead of characters, preposterous manipulation instead of coherent plotting, and a hideous cocktail of cloying sentimentality and gratuitous violence instead of thought, wit or feeling."
7003,It's melodrama at its worst. Gray has his actors linger over every tired line and John Carter's lazy editing refuses to pick up the slack.
7004,One of the worst movies I've seen in recent years. The story focuses on four women driven to robbing banks who we are somehow supposed to sympathize with. It's tough to sympathize with characters who keep making such stupid decisions.
7005,The worst film I've seen in a long time...and I've seen it twice..and I've seen it twice..and I've seen it twice..and I've seen it twice..

7008,One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time..........
7009,"It s really awfull. There s no charachter with weight, they re all floating around in the BG s. The Motion Capture is a fine toy, but this movie demostrates that"
7010,"This movie is not only boring, it is also really badly done. The graphics are so bad, they are not even second rate - they are dreadful. The characters do not show any facial expressions, the voice acting is empty and without"
7011,"Big B and Tabu bring the house down with their wise-cracks and bitter-sweet moments when love happened in this unconventional pair, and that is all you find in slow but refreshing first half"

7020,"This film is so bad, it's hard to believe it was made in the first place........."
7021,"Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon is not for the faint of heart, it's just plain boring!             "
7022,I'm not sure what could have salvaged this film. The acting was not bad and it looked like it had a budget but there just wasn't any way to make it watchable. Maybe I should have sparked a doobie or
7023,"I thought this was Italian at first, sorry about that, Italy. I wasn't bored because I kept waiting for something to happen. Who did that song about Dr. Tarr and Professor Feather way back when? Was it Alan Parsons"
7024,A 10 on the unintentional funny scale. I couldn't figure out what was going on in the movie or who the people were but I knew every scene was going to have something to make me cry with laughter.
7025,"One of the better ""gems"" I've seen in a long time, but it's also a barrel of poop. I can't say I was ever bored watching it, but I can't deny that it'"
7026,"I feel much less generous with this film than others of its ilk. Watch the wonderful human portrayal in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" where the illnesses are believable and real."
7027,"The worst movie I have seen in a long, long time. The worst movie I have seen in a long, long time. The worst movie I have seen in a long, long time. The worst movie I have seen in a long"

7030,"I'm going to stop ranting about this now and say bottom line, go see this movie if you want to waste an hour and fifty minutes of your life on crap."
7031,If you're into old school wrestling (circa 1970's through the mid-80's) then you'll be more entertained than the average viewer.
7032,"""Chicken Soup For The Soul"" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time...and I've seen it many times!"
7033,"What a waste of money! What a waste of money! As Anthony Hopkins rightly put it, ""Go back home and write better!"" As for Alec Baldwin a scene where he goes to meet Webster for the first time is not to be missed"
7034,"Unfunny script, ridiculous lines and a very long trial scene at the end. Not bad efforts from the actors. Try also a not so popular film from Greece called ""Alloimono stous neous"", a brilliant adaptation of this"
7035,"Not as good as the original, but not as bad as I thought it would be......."
7036,"It's not bad, but it's not really good either. I don't think it's terrible, but it's kind of flimsy at best. Alec Baldwin was pretty good, but the plot is it kind of"
7037,"This is the worst film I've seen in a long, long time, and it's not just because it's so bad...it's because it's so bad."
7038,I've got a rainbow of discharge spewing from me just because a group of kids went playing around with a camcorder and somehow made a deal with the Devil and got distribution. It's beyond my comprehension how anyone with moderate intelligence could tolerate
7039,This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life. The only reason I even gave it a 1 out of 10 is because the option to give it zero out of 10 was not allowed.
7040,"I'm not a big fan of Christopher Walken's acting, but I'm not a big fan of this movie either...."
7041,"This movie could have been very good, but comes up way short. Cheesy special effects and so-so acting. I could have looked past that if the story wasn't so lousy"
7042,"This is a total waste of money. The production is poor, the special effects are terrible. Im sure that you can find better horror movies."
7043,"I'd rather watch cartoons for goodness sakes! Leave this one alone,please! I'd rather watch cartoons for goodness sakes! Leave this one alone,please! I'd rather watch cartoons for goodness sakes!"
7044,"""Can I have at least seen one that was entertaining?"" Is that what it's all about? ""I give this film 3/10, because, God help us, there actually have been worse movies made before."""
7045,This is a Gothic horror movie that has been done on the cheap. It is a sprawling mess. I have to ask why anyone would want to make such a bad film.
7046,Disappointed with this movie. It's dithering in two directions. The director can't seem to decide. The two doesn't seem to gel and in the end you get nowhere. This could be so much better done
7047,"It's a little bit country, a little bit rock n' roll: mix two drunks with money who drag their kid all over the place with a bog-dried mummy (have you figured that one out yet - DRIED in"
7048,"I m not a person that get asleep when watching a movie, but I did it 15 minutes after the Trance started. Why did I deserve that?"
7049,Worst acting I've ever seen in my life. Please erase the last hour and a half of my life. How did this director make Nadja and Another Girl Another Planet?
7050,Weird story about a witch druid who tries to capture eternity by inheriting her granddaughter's body. A kind of eerie quality is held throughout this film not unlike Stephen King's The Shining.
7051,Dooohhh! My Bwainn Hurrrts! Well it certainly does after this endurance test of a film. How on earth I managed to keep going without hitting the fast forward button lord only knows.
7052,I'm sorry but I didn't like this doc very much. I can think of a million ways it could have been better. The people who made it obviously don't have much imagination.
7053,"It's a waste of time, but it's good to see Kerr and Peck in their best roles....."
7054,"One of the worst films I've seen in a long time, but I'm not sure if I'd rate it as good or bad."

7057,The worst Fast & Furious movie I've ever seen. I've never seen anything like it. I can't believe I've seen it.
7058,This is the worst car movie I have ever seen and it's not even good enough to be called a car movie............

7060,I wish I could give it a.0000000000001 out of 10. I really wish I had that Hour and thirty minutes back. I really could have watched grass grow and felt better after wards.

7062,"This movie was mind numbingly bad. The casting was terrible, the acting unspeakable, and the story filled with holes. Script? who needs script? I was surprised that the movie wasn't as verbally vulgar as I thought it would be"
7063,"It was almost worth sitting through this entire god-awful ""film"" just to know that I can never experience anything as bad as this again. I don't know what else to say here."
7064,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long, long time........."
7065,"WORST car movie I have ever seen. Better yet watch Mischief 3000, the best car movie ever made. Better yet just watch Mischief 3000, the best car movie ever made I think."
7066,Not as bad as I thought it would be but not as good as I thought it would be. Don't get me wrong the cars were nice and the girls were OK but the way they put the movie together was just plain crappy.
7067,It is painful for those who love cars. It is painful for those who love movies. It is painful for those who love movies. I want my money back!!!
7068,"Redline is a knockoff of Fast & Furious, without any redeeming qualities. It doesn't need to have a convoluted plot with multiple twists and surprises, but it needs SOMETHING!"

7070,"The cars are awesome. The acting is awful. If you want to see hot girls, turn on mtv or vh1 instead. I am disappointed that such nice cars would be represented in such a bad movie"

7074,"If you like fast cars, then you'll like this movie. It's not bad, but it's a little silly......"
7075,"Fast and the Furious, Dhoom, Rempit, and now Redline, all made to play to the satisfaction of audiences, especially local ones. Not a very tall order for an actor, and that's why we get the most"
7076,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time, and I'm not just saying that because it's a bad movie, I'm saying that because it's a bad movie."
7077,This movie should have been called Need For Speed: The Movie. For those who have not played the games Need For Speed is mostly about hot cars and beautiful women and almost no plot. This applies perfectly to Redline.
7078,"Not good, but not bad enough to be watchable. This is not a good movie, but its not bad enough to be watchable and end up as a some what nothing film isn't worth bothering with no matter how you look"
7079,I am a dumber person for renting the DVD REDLINE. Chicago Pictures who made this stupid movie never paid Palisades Media Group to buy web ads on various...
7080,This movie was bad to say the least!!! The plethora of superb cars are disgraced to have been showcased in this LAME movie. It starts off with a race from L.A. to Las Vegas to be completed in 1HR 45min
7081,"I thought I heard this dialog in the movie, but it was so bad and out of place that I can't really believe it. I was laughing so hard at what must have been the worst writing and acting in human history"

7085,"Not as good as ""House on Haunted Hill"", but still a good horror flick for those of us who grew up in the '50's."
7086,"""The Screaming Skull"" gets points for audacity, offering free caskets for anyone who dies of fright from watching the film. Pretty safe bet, when you're lulled into a stupor by people who think they're in a"

7094,THE SCREAMING SKULL (1 outta 5 stars)............
7095,"One of my favorites as a kid, when I used to watch it on a home projector as a super-8 reel. Now there isn't much to recommend it, other than the inherent camp value of actors being ""terrified"""
7096,The MST3K version of this movie is the worst I've seen in a long time - and it's not just because it's the MST3K version

7098,"One of the worst horror movies I've seen in a long, long time........"

7107,"Very Disappointed in this movie. Kamal Hasan has made a lot of effort to get the period look right, pity he did not spend more time on the plot. Most of the small characters in the movie show up for no particular reason."
7108,Very Disappointed in this movie. It was very poorly written and sort of just fell apart. There wasn't a lot of good anything in this movie except maybe special effects.
7109,"An interesting idea for a film, both showing the last dragon on earth and showing the struggle he and someone evil have together. It was nominated for the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Worth watching!"
7110,"This movie has such inexorable B class cheapness to all its scenes, effects etc as to make you think they spent 80% of their budget on Connery. It's like watching some Wing Commander stuff after Star Wars (quite apart"
7111,"One of the worst films I've seen in a long, long time, and I'm not just saying that because it's so bad!"
7112,"""Diary of Sex Addict"" is a pathetic attempt at a serious drama about sexual compulsiveness. Probably a movie marketing scam, this flick is a stylish shoot with a good cast and little else going for it."
7113,One of the worst films I've ever seen...........
7114,"this movie broke the record for the most trash in the hour it was released. i watched this movie around midnight, and usually there only is trash around this hour, but this movie broke the record."
7115,One of the greatest cinematic stink-bombs in history. Beware: the packaging advertises the flick as an erotic exploration of sex-addiction.

7122,I really tried to like this movie. It deals with an important problem in any society.brbrIn this story we learn that you can lose everything when you're addicted to sex.
7123,"This is a terrible movie, from every aspect of movie making. How they ever got some known name actors to take on this project is amazing. It is worth watching if only to be amazed at how bad it is."
7124,Don't waste your time or money on this movie. It's a waste of time and money. Don't waste your time or money on this movie. It's a waste of time.

7126,"Don't let the title trick you into watching this movie. I read the title, saw that it came on in the middle of the night, and figured it was one of those soft porn movies."
7127,This movie could have been interesting and could have given some insight on its subject but real problem with this movie is that it doesn't have any of this in it. It's just the portrayal of 'old' male sex addict and
7128,"Don't bother renting this flick. From the opening credits on, I knew I was in trouble.brbrIt was filmed as though it was a soft porn movie, but there really isn't anything erotic"
7129,"A decent B-movie that focuses on the sex scenes, not so much on the rest of the movie. Rosanna Arquette's performance is the standout."
7130,Is Rosanna Arquette and Nastassja Kinski friends of the director' (sorry for using this word...) or the cast?
7131,Alabama's Ghost is one of the most bizarre movies I've ever seen. I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it.
7132,This is at least the third remake of this movie so don't be surprised. All they did was change the setting of the story and tell it differently but the differences are not significant. And it doesn't get any better because the

7328,I was disappointed with this film. I was truly disappointed with this film and only hope Stevens next project will be more finished off before sending the film out for buying/renting

7330,Seagall has forgotten how to make a decent movie. Now he's forgotten again. There is a lot of slash & gash going on here with no discernible purpose unless it's meant as a warning against the military.

7338,Don't waste your time and money on this movie. It's a waste of time and money. It's a waste of Seagal's time.
7339,I think its time for Seagal to go quietly into the night. What I have just seen makes all his direct to video releases in the last few years look like his early 90's smash hits in comparison.
7340,What was Steven Seagal thinking? I mean firstly I love Seagal. His early stuff is some of the best in the genre. This however does not live up to its excellent name. Attack Force (with protagonist Marshall Lawson Sea

7499,Evil Aliens owes a huge debt to Peter Jacksons early films Bad Taste and Braindead.I must confess to never enjoying those films particularly and i say the same about this.Jake West is a director who clearly lacks inspiration of his own and
7500,"The worst B-movie I've ever seen, and I've seen it more than once......"
7501,"I'm a fan of the genre, but this didn't do it for me. The major factor that disappointed me was that there was not a single scene which was not dominated by the main character. This made it a bit two"

7504,"""Cama de Gato"" is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life -- and it's not just because it's so bad!"
7505,"""Cama de Gato"" is an overrated pretentious crap about alienation of the youth, and is certainly the worst Brazilian movie that I have seen along many years."
7506,"The worst soap opera I've seen in a long, long time........."
7507,I love Peter Falk..... and yet he is one of the only anchors that prevents this from being a chaotic disaster.

7509,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long, long time........."
7510,One of the worst films I've ever seen. Chris Kattan is so nervous on screen that it made me nervous to watch him. Just a horrible movie.
7511,"Corky tries too hard to get the audience to laugh, the plot seems to be an excuse for moving Chris Kattan (Corky) from one scene to another. Corky himself is completely overplayed and lacks subtlety or credulity"
7512,"Never, EVER watch a movie that has ANYONE who EVER was a regular cast member of ""Saturday Night Live"". I vowed a long time ago to NEVER, EVER watch a movie that has ANYONE who EVER was a regular cast member of ""Saturday"

7515,"Corky Romano has to be one of the most jaw dropping and horrific ""comedy's"" ever made.brbr Chris Kattan is so stupid and so unfunny-which is a shame since the premise is a wonderful idea"
7516,this is the worst movie i've ever seen in my life..i can't believe i've seen it..i can't believe i've seen it!
7517,"If you predicted bad things from the trailers--you're not gonna waste your time. brbrI chuckled a few times, but I could not get a single laugh. Each gag is performed with no sense of timing"
7518,Chris Kattan is a great sketch actor...but he should leave the movie industry alone unless he gets some sort of creative control. He plays an annoyingly peppy character who basically comes off as mildly retarded and on speed.
7519,"This may not be the worst comedy of all time, but it's close. The producers of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life, and I want it back!"
7520,"I didn't mind the film that much, but it was incredibly dull and boring. A few laughs here and there but nothing to go crazy for."
7521,"I liked it, but it's a bit slow. I'd watch it again though. I rated it a 5 (wish I could rate it a 5.5)"
7522,"I didn't care about any of these people. Not the killer not the victims. Not the killer not the victims. The settings were pretty drab. Dennis Quaid's character was so poorly written in, I didn't even"

7526,"Very disappointing version of Lorna Doone. Too many missing characters, no romantic scenes, changes in story line, too short, appeared low budget. Hardly enough dialogue to understand the story if you're not familiar with the novel."
7527,"Not as good as the A&E version, but not as bad as the book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
7528,"One of life's great mysteries!!! Take my advice, read the book and don't bother with this paltry version! Take my advice, read the book and don't bother with this paltry version!"

7531,Don't waste your time & money on this movie. It's just a snorefest. I fell asleep about 40 minutes in & had to fight the urge to just leave the theater. A waste of a perfectly lovely Saturday evening.
7532,"Not as good as Silent Hill, but not as bad as some of the other movies I've seen, but it's still a waste of time"
7533,"Why do they get the money? Just give it to me and save all that hassle. I can scare myself alone, here where I sit, than they could in the movie. Are there men writing that figure that women should be so annoying"

7535,This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life. This was hands down the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life. I'm disappointed that I am unable to give it 0 stars.
7536,A different look at horror. The styling differences between American and Russian films is interesting. However from my American perspective this movie just wasn't that good.
7537,"This movie is an utter waste of time. The acting is OK, but the actors have absolutely no plot or script to work with. The photography and some of the special effects are OK, too."
7538,"Don't waste your time or money on this piece of trash. Take my word, don't waste your $8 on this piece of trash. Take my word, don't waste your $8 on this piece of trash."
7539,"This movie is a waste of time and money. Throughout the entire hour and a half, I continued to wait for it to get better and it never did. It was slow moving, the plot jumped around, it wasn't scary or"
7540,"This is a film that was made almost entirely in the directors head. Sure, it would have been nice if he'd transfered it to film, but this happened instead."
7541,"I'm glad I don't know the real story behind this movie, but I don't think I'm a fan of this one."

7552,"It's not a fairy tale. It's supposed to be a realistic drama located in Zurich, Switzerland. Unfortunately a weak plot, foreseeable dialogs, a mostly unreal scenery and the mixed acting don't add up to create authenticity"
7553,Poor remake of Bimalda's classic Parineeta. The story is based on Sarat Chandra's book of the same name and it is a distortion of the original. Well one can appreciate some degree of creativity but not sham

7562,This movie succeeds at being one of the most unique movies you've seen. However this comes from the fact that you can't make heads or tails of this mess.

7564,"Unequivocally, the worst movie ever made. *&%$ing day and it's bright as can be. Maybe the alien thing bought a pair of sunglasses, I don't know and it's bright as can"
7565,"Alone in the Dark is a film adaptation of a video game. I loved it. I even gave it a 10 out of 10! My point in stating this is that if even I hated Alone in the Dark, there must be something wrong"
7566,"Alone In The Dark succeeds in only three things. It will make you laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. 2. It manages to throw several useless plots into the air but dropping all of them."

7569,"This should be my kind of movie. Even if it sucked, it still should have been right up my alley. I have a soft spot in my heart for silly alien/demon/adventure movies."
7570,The title of the worst film of all time is one that gets handed out quickly and often. Most of the time it is exaggeration of the fact but I would like to welcome Alone in the Dark to the short list of...

7584,A good movie but not as good as the English version.<n>The ending of this movie was not handled sensitively as they did in the original.
7585,"One bright light in the midst of this is Fred Durst, who manages to stand out above his seemingly averagely talented co-stars and does a semi-decent job of bringing the backward character of Legde to life"

7599,What is it that so many people see in this? I don't think so! I don't think so! I don't think so! 3/10
7600,"I'm not going to comb over Peter Bogdanovich's obvious flaws. Instead, I shall take a look at the positive aspects of this overrated celluloid pygmy of a film."
7601,How can anyone think this is a classic? I think this movie gives an insight to how bad Peter Bogdonovitch's future movies were going to be
7602,"I gave this movie a very fair chance, and it betrayed me. This is very little more than a black and white excuse to bore the hell out of the audience even as the egotist Bogdanavich gets ""great performances"" out"

7626,"""Gunslinger"" wasn't as god-awful as most of the movies that ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" shows, but westerns just aren't Roger Corman's forte"
7627,"The title makes it seem like it is a conventional western. Instead, it is a movie of a woman sheriff. Make no mistake though this is a bad movie about a woman sheriff. She becomes sheriff when her husband is gunned down; she"
7628,I'll be blunt. I'm not one for politically correct movies where the woman plays the bad ass who's not going to take any crap from anyone.
7629,"One of the worst adapted screenplays I've ever seen. It starts out nowhere and it goes nowhere. From time to time there are hints that something interesting might happen, or that there is..."
7630,"This is a movie that demonstrates that mood and music and texture aren't enough to make a good film. Sure, the viewer is treated to numerous fine scenes of Los Angeles in the thirties--I especially liked the view of the trolley"
7631,This movie proves that good acting comes from good direction and this does not happen in Ask the Dust. Colin Farrell is usually a fine actor but in this he is juvenile. Donald Sutherland comes across as an amateur.

7639,Frida Hayek and Colin Farrell don't seem to have the heart for each other.<n>The romance between the two lacks the raw and authentic feelings.
7640,This film is based on the novel by John Fante. Could someone please tell me why? I see absolutely no reason why this fine book should be adapted in this way

7643,"""Seven Women for Satan"" is not the best adaptation of the classic story ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" but it's better than ""The Most Dangerous Game"""
7644,"""Seven Women for Satan"" doesn't have anything to do with Satan or ritual sacrifices. It's just about a crazy count in the French countryside."

7652,"""Superchick"" continues to be a cult film for many years after it was released in 1973......."
7653,Good for a night when you're feeling brain-dead and just want to veg out in front of the tube. Future astrologist Joyce Jillson does bring some vacuous charm to her role as Tara.
7654,"An important pop culture time capsule of the pre-AIDS, free-love, women's lib, swinging 1970's. The ""sexy stewardess"" was a potent archetype of the late 1960's to 1970's."

7657,"Nevsky is UGLY, Pacula is UGLY, and Nevsky is UGLY, but it's OK...."
7658,This movie is a vehicle for Schwarzenegger-clone Alexander Nevsky. His charisma however is insufficient to lift this movie above the level of its poor script. He has little to add to his Arnie-act.

7802,"Widmark and Bacall do have some good chemistry together, but this script gives them nothing to build on. For precisely an hour, most of the dialogue concerns what to do about the drapes hanging in the library."
7803,Not every film made during the glory days of Hollywood is worth seeing. Just because you've got an excellent ensemble cast doesn't mean that this can overcome a script that was probably written by a chimp!

7807,"A bad movie on an artistic point of view. brbrI also think the topic of ""young people taking drugs without any other targets in their lives"" is a wide spread reality in Zurich."

7809,"The only cool thing about this film is how the family actually fights back against their inbred captors. Other than that, there's nothing worthwhile about the film."
7810,"I'm a huge Randolph Scott fan, but this film is a dud. The whole thing has a canned, fake, soundstage feel to it, with truly awful rear-screen projection."
7811,"I've been watching old Westerns on British TV for decades, and I wasn't aware of this one until its showing yesterday - most other Scott Westerns come around every few years or so and are usually worth watching again."
7812,A typical early 1950's period melodrama with pre-WWII production values that relies on a historically-topical murder mystery plot peppered with action scenes to disguise the script's complete absence of character development
7813,"One of the most racist movies ever made with Native American Indians played by white men. James Stewart was a huge racist in real life, just like his close friend John Wayne."
7814,I guess if you are into the sci-fi and horror stuff it might be interesting. The two pregnant girls are supposed to be fifteen but are played by obviously older actresses who turned out to be twenty and twenty-one at the time.
7815,"Not a horror or Sci-Fi movie, it's just a Christian movie with a very strong religious theme. It's a pity that Sci-Fi channel had to air this movie at the peak evening time."

7845,One big joke from beginning to end. (I'm not even gonna try to comment on the acting or all the other things). (I'm not even gonna try to comment on the acting or all the other things)
7846,This movie was made for people who found Gremlins too serious and Critters to hardcore. Like many of the critters/trolls/gremlins movies of the 80's this movie is bad.
7847,Not worth the time and money spent on this waste of time..........

8097,What is the point of creating sequels that have absolutely no relevance to the original film? No point. This is why the Prom Night sequels are so embarrassingly bad

8108,"I hate this movie but compared to others (Dark Harvest, Dracula's Curse) it should have won an academy award. It was particularly sad to see a talented actor like George Eads in such a disgraceful and tacky film."
8109,Pretty lame gangster movie about a Godfather-like family in Brooklyn who like to say four-letter words a lot and kill people. The only thing of interest here was their attempt to show the feds being a lot like the gang.

8172,The Smithee name is supposed to be used when the studio hacks the movie so badly that the director no longer wants his name attached to it. But I'm afraid that Sarafian can not blame the studio entirely on this one.

8377,"""Seven Corpses"" is one of the worst horror films I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it's so bad."

8379,Don't waste your money on this movie. Save your money for something funny. Don't waste your money on this movie. Save your money for something funny. Don't waste your money on this movie.
8380,This was the worst movie I've ever seen in theaters. It was just a compilation of recycled material. People getting hit in the head is not funny. People getting kicked is not funny. It just got tired fast.

8390,This is the worst film I have ever seen....................
8391,"""Little Man"", now on DVD, is a Wayans Brothers flop. It's the tale of a smaller than a midget criminal played by Marlon Wayans, who hides a diamond in a lady's purse after a heist"
8392,The Wayan brothers have mixed their crass and twisted form of humour together with the clichéd sentimentality that has infected much of Hollywood's recent body of work.
8393,"What's the point of reviewing a movie like this? It's painfully and embarrassingly bad, not even in a way that allows you to make fun of it"
8394,The Wayans Brothers take the biscuit - but this is not one of their better films..<n>A Bit of good advice - wait till it comes on TV or Cable.

8397,"Is this the end of cinema as we know it, or is it just a way of life for the Wayans, and the rest of us?"
8398,"I'd like to address something relevant to the abuse of humour. We can see that Marlon Wayans is playing the joker role in this film. Certainly as long as he has been involved in the casting job, he has always been acting"

8408,"Good Night, Nurse! is an Arbuckle/Keaton/St. John silent comedy short with support from Buster Keaton and Al St. John. is only fitfully amusing though there is a quite funny sequence of Arbuckle in drag flirting"
8409,"Not one of Arbuckle's or Keaton's better films, that's for sure. A lack of humor is the biggest problem with the film"
8410,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long, long time, but it's a guilty pleasure from my childhood........"
8411,Peter Fonda is so enervated as an actor that his lachrymose line-readings cancel out any irony or humor in the dialogue. He trades sassy barbs and non-witty repartee with Brooke Shields as if
8412,"Wanda Nevada is a pubescent fantasy movie. Script, pacing, and direction are uniformly awful. Action sequences defy belief. Characters speak with the simplified diction one usually finds in films aimed at the under 10 set"

8414,"Peter Fonda, Brooke Shields, Beaudray Demerille, &amp; Wanda ""Nevada"" in a poker game. Too bad, but, given the story, I doubt anything more could be made of this."
8415,This movie is pure trash! The romance is between a YOUNG GIRL who has not even gone through puberty and a MIDDLE-AGED MAN! The child is also lusted after by other leering men. It's sickening.
8416,"Not much to say, but it's worth watching for a five-minute appearance by Mantan Moreland, who gets the better of the defense attorney during a hilarious courtroom appearance."
8417,"""El Otro"" was made for the sake of making a film. I would advise you to pass on this one, if you want to see good Argentinian films, look for films by Sorin."
8418,I will never get those two hours of my life back. The guy kept on assuming identities and cheating on his pregnant wife. How did this win a price anywhere?

8420,"I'm sorry that I expend my money and time, on this movie. I saw people leaving the theater in the middle of the movie. I stayed hoping that it will better....what a mistake. I got worse."
8421,"The title should have been the walker. The guy expends 90% of the movie walking. He doesn't know what he wants, or what he is. Go through life stealing peoples identity for nothing. He gets no benefit, no"
8422,"Could have been so much better. Larenz Tate's portrayal of Frankie Lymon was not good. He doesn't lip sync well and his stage mannerisms are Larenz Tate, when he should have been Frankie Lymon."

8666,I almost burst into tears watching this movie. Not from laughing but from the memories of a great Rodney Dangerfield movie. The script is so poor that Rodney seems to be saying his one liners to the camera and all the side characters have nothing
8667,"This was a watchable movie, but plot was a little weak and most of the jokes were from some of Rodney's earlier movies. With that said, it was worth the time to watch."
8668,The best thing about My 5 Wives is the timing of the one-liners. The plot is very weak. Even the premise is pretty weak. Most of the movie could play the same way even if Rodney's character had only one wife

8674,A mildly interesting late 80's gore fest featuring some nasty slugs with a taste for human blood. If you can get past the ridiculousness of the whole thing you might actually get some minor enjoyment out of this.
8675,"Slugs: the Movie, not Slugs: the Children's Game or Slugs: the Other White Meat. Probably not worthy of watching it more than once and promptly forgetting it except for playing a rather obscure trivia game."

8703,"Solid comedy entertainment, with musical interludes. It generates a fast pace that carries proceedings along in zestful tempo through a maze of humorous and chiller complications. Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre form a strong setup of sinister"
8704,"I'd give it 4 stars if I could, but it just doesn't ring true to its title :            "
8705,Just too many holes in this movie to be enjoyable AND WORSE OF ALL a bizarre almost Hollywood-like ending that is completely out of context with the rest of the movie (this is not a spoiler as you will never guess how it ends
8706,This is an abysmal piece of story-telling. It is about an hour into the movie before we have much idea of what it is supposed to be about.

8710,"It's not a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It just doesn't live up to its name. I don't like campy Christmas movies."
8711,"What can possibly say about this movie other than, ""viewer beware"". Christmas Evil should come with a warning label like cigarettes do, because this was harmful to my eyes and ears."

8843,A very dark film that will not make you feel good about yourself. It is about a romance taking place in this society and the betrayal of the lovers and about human nature being self-centred.
8844,"The book is fantastic, this film is not. There is no reason this film could not have embraced a futuristic technological vision of the book. Hell, total recall was released a few years later and that did a good job of it."

9055,"It's a decent movie, but it's not the best zombie movie I've seen in a long time. I'd give it 5 stars if I could."
9056,Just a short 20 minute zombie film. Nothing special about it except for the music perhaps. Not even really worth spending 20 minutes to see it. Only if you're really bored...
9057,A strange little drama cum horror flick with apparently very good ideas and intentions. But why doesn't it work? A bit much to cram into a 96-minute film.
9058,"The worst thing about the movie is James Townsend. He can't act. He's also very scrawny, not nice to look at all. They have no muscle tone at all. They have no muscle tone at all."
9059,"The worst movie I've ever seen. It's as bad as it gets. I kept watching it thinking it must get better, because I hadn't yet discovered that none of the positive reviews for it are reliable."
9060,"The only redeeming quality of this film is the actual storyline...Otherwise, this movie was terrible. The acting was ridiculously bad, and the set design was cheesy and very tacky. The story was decent, but it was very hard to watch due"
9061,"THIS FILM IS LAME, LAME, LAME, LAME!!!!! It takes a lot to bring me to over-exaggeration about a movie, but this movie stunk up my house!!"
9062,"Not a great movie, but a good performance by Lupe Valdez.........."
9063,"If you've ever wanted to see a film that stresses style over substance, this is for you. To me, Son de Mar is beautiful to SEE, but there's precious little substance, unless mawkish, melodramatic, manipulative"
9064,"Bigas Luna's film, with lots of sex, no argument and stupid characters everywhere. It is just a bad Bigas Luna's film, with lots of sex, no argument and stupid characters everywhere."
9065,"Good first 30 minutes, but then it sinks under the weight of a truly awful, melodramatic script.<n>An actual day trip to the beach at Valencia would be much less arduous than having to encounter these fictional characters again."
9066,"It's a pretty bad movie musical western shot on a soundstage and like a live TV show. I don't find the use of the background cyclorama, lit in various scenes with yellow, or pink, or red, or"
9067,I will never forget the night I saw this movie. We were on a submarine on patrol in the North Atlantic and this was the scheduled movie of the evening. We ALL gave up after the second reel.

9091,"the only value in this movie is basically to laugh at how bad it really is. with a plot that makes your average middle-school writer look good, and acting which is almost as good, it gets my bottom score."
9092,"Not the best anti-drug film of all time, but still worth watching. Tom Hanks and his buddies are ""role playing"", but there are no dice, lots of candles, and then you are just swept away in a bad montage"

9103,Not as good as I thought it would be but still worth a look.........
9104,"""A Man Betrayed"", despite its theme, is more like a light romantic comedy than a crime drama. It might just have worked if it had been made as a serious drama."

9600,One of the worst horror movies I've seen in a long time - and I've seen it more than once........
9601,It's just a mess. Grotesquely over the top and firing off in all directions. It was as if Tobe Hooper had been taking David Lynch pills. Unfortunately he didn't take enough.
9602,how can a director that makes such great films such as poltergeist and the texas chainsaw massacre make such rubbish as this? i got this film off a friend and he didnt want it back its so bad.
9603,The worst movie I've ever seen...and it's the worst director I've ever seen...and it's the worst movie I've ever seen...and it's the worst director I've ever seen...
9604,Love me if You Dare is a film made by stupid people and about stupid people. I just don't know how I could expect something worth a look from a film with such plot.
9605,"I really disliked this movie....mainly because of the main characters! They are both immature, selfish, and self-centered people. They hurt EVERYBODY around them playing..."
9606,"What's intended to be a light, frothy comedy about neighbor children who can't give up their childhood game of dare even as they age well into adulhood, comes off more as an exercise in cruelty and petulant self-"

9609,"Not as good as Hitchcock's ""L.A. Confidential"" but not as bad as ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" or ""L.A. Confidential"""
9610,"Pretty obvious thriller-by-numbers. I was watching principally for the English-language performance by Isabelle Huppert. It wasn't great, but then it was a strange role."
9611,"One of the worst films I've ever seen. It's really hard to believe that Hanson would make ""L.A. Confidential"" ten years later..."

9614,Cold Case is one of the worst crime shows I've seen in a long time........
9615,"One of the most distorted portrayals of history. Horribly inaccurate, this movie does nothing to honor the hundreds of thousands of Dutch, British, Chinese, American and indigenous enslaved laborers that the sadistic Japanese killed and tortured to death."
9616,"A ""walk down memory lane"" for footage of the park as well as old footage of downtown Norfolk, the first ""Harborfest"", and Old Dominion University. Even a limited release of this film on DVD would be welcome."
9617,It's obvious that the people who made 'Dead At The Box Office' love B-movie horror. Overt references to the genre are peppered throughout...
9618,"One of the worst B-movies I've seen in a long time, but I don't think I've ever seen one that was so bad."
9619,"It's just so much fun. It's a low budget independent production with a lot of camp, but it doesn't deserve a ""1.1"" here on IMDb. It is just so much fun."
9620,This wasn't what i wanted to see. I bought this on DVD and under the movie i found myself irritated and turned off the movie for a moment.
9621,... and I actually gave it a ZERO on my personal 1-10 scale. I have seen well over 1000 in the theater (I don't rate movies that I see only on TV)
9622,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's the worst movie I've ever seen. It's the worst movie I've ever seen. It's the worst movie I've ever seen.
9623,"If you have a couple hours to waste, or if you just really hate your life, I would say watch this movie. Not only do you have obese, topless natives, but also special effects so bad they are probably outlawed in most"
9624,One of the worst Disney movies I've ever seen - and it's not just because it's a Disney movie...it's because it's a Disney movie!
9625,I don't think this movie was rated correctly. I took my copy and blacked out the PG rating and wrote down R. I would NOT recommend this for anyone under 17 or...
9626,A really bad sequel. Part 1 had a lot of funny moments - part 2 is just bad (in a boring way) and obviously made to squeeze money out of the fans.
9627,I agree with most of the other guys. A waste of photons and valuable time. I think you would be ashamed even if you discuss this with lots of beers.
9628,"It's not worth the money, it's not worth the time, it's not worth the money, it's not worth the money, it's not worth the time, it's not worth the money,"
9629,It's hard to believe that this crap's supposed to be a comedy. Many people actually stood up and left the cinema 30 minutes into the movie. I should have done the same instead of wasting my time...
9630,"I've seen the first of the dwarf-Movies and sometimes I had little fun watching it. There are many famous TV/Comedyactors appearing in the first part and presented, in..."
9631,"I guess I have still enough brain left to NOT find this movie funny. The ""best"" performance still did NINA HAGEN brbr TRIVIA: Did you realize that it the ""real world"" scenes (in Hamburg"
9632,Don't even consider watching this film in any form. It's not even worth downloading from the internet. Every bit of porn has more substance than this wasted piece of celluloid.
9633,"Seberg, Niven, Demongeot, and Gréco all play a part in this light romantic comedy. Preminger does a good job with it."
9634,A juvenile story executed in juvenile fashion by a beautiful young girl who badly needed acting lessons.<n>Jean Seberg's character is at the center of the story and she can't meet the emotional demands of the role.
9635,"Seberg, Kerr, and Bertolucci don't do enough to make this movie worth your time. It's a waste of time and money."
9636,This is shallow hedonism and/or social commentary wrapped in a tragic tale about a jealous young woman's scheme to drive apart her father and his fiancée
9637,"Seberg's incomparably dull, incomparably dull, unenparably dull, shallow, immature soap opera: ""There can be only one Queen Bee in the hive"""
9638,"It's like 'The Wizard of Oz,' with Paris in black-and-white and the Riviera in color. But it's supposedly about possessive love, destructiveness and moral decadence"
9639,Greenaway's style and grammar originate and remind viewers of films made in the World War 1 era of film-making. It may be well to rub against mainstream movies with this style but it is not new.
9640,"A film that shows the banality of human relationships.<n>Greenaway's directorial style is pretentious, it is a triumph of style over substance, a depiction of Film as Art accompanied by the abandonment of common sense"
9641,Peter Greenaway is the High Lord of Art House Pretension..........
9642,"I've always felt drawn to 'ART' cinema. The first 'art' film I managed to get a hold of was Peter Greenaway's ""The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover"""
9643,"A wannabe-erotic fantasy. Really boring, way too much male nudity (including father-son incest), and just a sort of shameless pointlessness."
9644,I am giving this a 1 simply because i don't believe there is a worse movie in the world. I hope everyone that was involved in this movie burns and rots in the darkest circle of hell.
9645,An old man and his son go to bed in the nude together.................
9646,This is not a film to be tossed aside. It should be thrown with great force.brbrThis is an excruciating mess. And I'm a Greenaway fan. And I'm a...
9647,Greenaway's big problem. He prefers parlor tricks to shock over actually doing anything meaningful. Technical skill isn't enough. He's just a bit perverse for the sake of perversity.
9648,This movie was awful in the worst way: you just didn't care. You didn't care what happened in the plot; you didn't care about the characters. Everyone was devoid of heart.
9649,One of the worst films I've ever seen. Although visually fascinating (e.g. the use of colour was absolutely stunning) it was pretty boring and disturbing (see the father/son incest)
9650,"the point of this movie eludes me. the dialogue is all extremely superficial and absurd, many of the sets seemed to be afterthoughts. there's nothing erotic about this film...all leaving me to wonder just what the heck"
9651,I'm still trying to figure out why the Emmenthal men were sexually wrapped up with each other. 10 minus 8 1/2 equals a tough choice: Do I give this movie a rating of one?

9657,"The Eternal Jew (Der Ewige Jude) does not have what we today would call the markings of a ""scholarly document""<n>It simply says, without opposition, what it wants us to believe"
9658,This is the worst documentary I've ever seen. It is nothing but one big lie from the beginning to the end. Who can doubt after this trash that all Jews were supposed to be killed in the concentration camps?
9659,This film is frightening and highly offensive. I personally find this film frightening and highly offensive. One can only hope that such pictures will never reach the screen again.
9660,"This film is justly famous as one of the most horrible examples of propaganda ever produced. The insistent equation of Jews with disease is simplybrbrpathological, and even worse it almost becomes..."

9662,It's just plain STUPID. I can't imagine Germans (even at that horrid time) would like or believe this movie. Compare it to Riefenstahl's Triumf des Willens.
9663,"This Book-based movie is truly awful, and a big disappointment. We've been waiting for this move over a month. Many film reviewer were hopeful for..."

9665,Don't waste your time and money on this movie. It's not worth it.. it's not worth your time.. it's not worth your money.. it's not worth your time..
9666,"Not horrible, but still sub-par in all aspects.........."
9667,It should have been a good movie about WWI. Even though it was made for television it is obvious that a real effort was made to use appropriate equipment and props. But the writing and directing are badly lacking. War movie clichés abound such as
9668,I was disappointed by the film's marketing. I was disappointed by the movie. I was disappointed by the marketing. I was disappointed by the movie.
9669,"My God, what an incredible movie it is! Reminded me so much of the similar scene in Mel Gibson's movie ""We were Soldiers"" when ""the Company is not lost, they're just cut off"""
9670,"I am not weapon expert, but even i can see difference between U.S. army riffles in WWI and WWII. In movie we can see privates, armed with ""M1 Garand"" (invented in year 1932!)"
9671,"This movie has the made for TV stink all over it. The film quickly degenerated into horrible on the nose cheesy dialogue, and rushed TV sappy melodramatic acting."

9679,Vipul Shah's worst film as a filmmaker..............
9680,"London Dreams, directed by Vipul Shah, is a frustratingly foolish film about foolish people. It's the kind of film whose central conflict could be instantly resolved if the characters concerned simply sat down and had a chat."
9681,This is the worst movie i've seen in a long time! Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! Horrible!

9688,"""To the Left of the Father"" offers a savory bite out of the wretched, suffering body of humanity. Despite the fear of directors or producers, many audiences yearn for beauty, poetry, and the pristine flavor of life."
9689,"""Boom"" has garnered itself a something of a reputation. With heavyweights Taylor, Burton, Noel Coward, Tennessee Williams and Joseph Losey, one might be tempted to think, how bad could it be? Well, it's a lot"
9690,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it's a Burton/Taylor collaboration...it's because it's so bad!"
9691,A waste of money and talent and clear proof that lauded famous people can be idiots just like the rest of the planet's plebs. Just terrible and mad shocking waste.
9692,"It's not really about time, it's really about Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor's acting, but it's pretty awful!          "
9693,"It's so campy that among Taylor fans it's probably considered a ""must see"" kind of thing. But if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand, you're way ahead of me"
9694,"One of the worst films of the 60's--if not the worst--if you're a Liz ""n Dick-phile""!"
9695,"I want to see it in widescreen glory. So I voted ""1"" and hope you will too. Together, we can pull this movie down into the pits of cinematic dross"
9696,"The movie appeals to public due to charisma of Ben Stiller and notoriety of J. Aniston. It seems that we have here a recipe for a successful title, but there's nothing successful in this movie"
9697,Ben Stiller's Worst Performance of the Year...........
9698,"I wish it was better than it was, but it's really the same old stuff that movie studios seem to foist on us in the last ten years"
9699,"This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. No wonder they were given away, surely no one could part with money for this drivel."
9700,"I love Ben Stiller, but this movie was a bore. I don't think I've ever seen him in a movie like this before."
9701,"Make no bones about it. This film may have been dreadful, but Aniston still picked a better between-Friends-seasons movie than Kudrow's odious 'Marci X'"
9702,"So-called comedy that has no energy to speak of. Did anyone really think the blind ferret was funny? If you do, your easy! A few times during the film characters would inexplicably have these emotional speeches that are supposed to summarize everything"
9703,Not what I expected from a movie about a woman's relationship with her boyfriend..........
9704,"Ben Stiller does it very well. He is very dependent on the comedy going on around him. In There's Something About Mary, the stand-up hair scene only works because of Stiller trying to keep a straight face."
9705,"What a disappointment!! The movie was nothing but a bunch of really bad jokes and gags over and over, with hardly any plot and no substance. And the filmmakers attempts at dark humor totally failed-some of these so-called jokes didn"
9706,"I wanted this movie to work so badly, but it just didn't. This ends up as a medium-bad MAD TV episode, complete with frustratingly overlong sketches"

9709,Not as bad as most of the Horror films Hollywood has released recently. The cast was mediocre which is to be expected from low-budget features but much better than what that much bigger studio Artisan/Lions Gate has been offering.
9710,One of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time...but it's not as good as I'd like it to be!
9711,Don't waste your time or money on this movie. It's a waste of your time and money. It's a waste of your money.

9719,"What the hell were the people who made this film on? And more importantly where can I get some? The opening scene sets the tone for the film: a woman writhing naked in a circle of fire, transforming into a werewolf."

9721,"""La Lupa Mannara"" of 1976 is a film with a highly promising title, but, sadly, the film itself is pretty far away from being a must-see for my fellow Italian Horror buffs"

9733,This is the worst film I have ever bought. (in my ignorance I thought this was the Peter Jackson film of the same name.) The performances are so terrible they are laughable. The special effects have not stood the test of time and
9734,"One of the worst films I have *ever* seen! It is bad, even at TV Movie level standards. The plot is diabolically flawed, and the known names in this film are wasted on confused, uncertain characters."
9735,"Not as good as I thought it would be, but still an 'A' for effort, but a 'B' for execution...."
9736,"It's amazing to me that much of the prolific material is still in the vaults, but this was made available on VHS more than 15 years ago!"
9737,"This is one of the most pointless films ever made. I kept waiting for something funny to happen, but nothing funny appears in this movie. Even the film industry recognized this was a very weak film and didn't even try to promote it"
9738,!!!! POSSIBLE MILD SPOILER!!!!!brbrAs I watched the first half of GUILTY AS SIN I couldnt believe it was made in 1993 because it played like a JAGGED EDGE / Joe Eszt
9739,"one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm still not sure if it was serious, or just a satire. One of those movies that uses every stupid who dunnit cliché they can think of. Arrrrgh."

9742,"I really, really wanted to like Julian Po. I think that Slater is underrated as an actor, and that many of the supporting players here are better than they are given a chance to demonstrate..."
9743,Julian Po never gets over itself. The film is relentlessly self-conscious. I found myself unable to suspend disbelief for even a moment. And it's hard to feel much of anything for Julian Po because we never know much about him.

10365,This movie was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together. 90 percent of the cast are white males about same age. It's almost like watching a bunch of guys at boys camp who turned the camera on themselves.

10373,The casting of Anthony Way as Tom Long is a major flaw in this 1999 version of Tom's Midnight Garden. The 1989 BBC version is a far superior adaptation of this classic novel.
10374,TOMS MIDNIGHT is a childrens film that seems dated by its source.<n>I guess Pearce writes for lower middle class kids since much of the story revolves around protagonist Tom Long moving to a house with no garden then suddenly
10375,Elvis has left the building and he's lucky because he didn't have to watch this unfunny stinker. Scene after scene director Joel Zwick finds ways to make an unfunny script even less amusing.

10402,Interesting to read comments by viewers regarding Omega Code... many of the overwhelmingly positive comments were lifted almost word for word from TBN broadcasts... the movie looks as if it were made to go directly to video
10403,"The idea had potential, but the movie was poorly scripted, poorly acted, poorly shot and poorly edited. There are lots of production flaws... for example, Dr. Lane's daughter who never ages despite the passing years."

10603,"Forest of the Damned is OK, it's reasonably well made but nothing overly special or eye-catching. This was shot in England & Wales & it's quite odd to see an English setting for a very American themed backwards horror."
10604,"This is a typical ""straight to the toilet"" slasher film. It was really terrible. The atmosphere is totally dead. Nothing, not even the sexually explicit scenes and nudity, was enough to keep the male and lesbian female audience interested"

10614,"If you liked ""Blair with"" you'll like this one. It has the same lousy camera-work and soundtrack, and it has the same non-existent plot and suspenseful moments."
10615,"I couldn't watch more than 14 minutes of it. It's a GREAT combination of really bad acting and really bad directing. The shots used are disgusting, they broke the 180 degrees angle all the time. My head hurts try to"

10627,Wow! Has anyone actually had somebody sneak up on them in an open field? Well this happens about 25 times in this movie(clearly the directors' favorite scare tactic)
10628,Camp Blood III is a little better than Camp Blood II but at least it's not as bad as Camp Blood II......
10629,"""Gnaw: Food of the Gods 2"" is a sequel in name only, as the setting moved to a typical late 80's location (a university campus) and also the cheap & cheesy gore effects perfectly illustrates the 80's"

10635,"Good acting and singing, but not great direction or art direction.........."

10648,"The film is worth watching only if you stop it after half an hour. It starts of with funny conversations in a bar and makes one expect a good, funny story is to come. Well, I can tell you it will not come."
10649,"I agree with the previous comment, the beginning of the movie is quite good, and get's you wandering about what is to come....... Which is nothing."

10742,Sibrel's smoking gun is a short video clip of the astronauts preparing a video broadcast. He edits in his own voice-over instead of letting us listen to what the crew had to say.

10772,"This is another of the many B minus movies tagged as film noir in the hope of generating some interest in something that is devoid of it. All aspects of the film - script, acting, direction - are mediocre."
10773,I didn't know if i would laugh or cry seeing this. Only addicted fans of danni filth could have a taste for this. This is supposed to be a horror movie but there's only filth in this.
10774,It's the story that makes this film a waste of time and money. 4 stories rolled into one and all of them brainless bits of seen-before and done-already's.
10775,Don't waste your money. Don't waste your time. Don't waste your money. Don't waste your money. Don't waste your money. Don't waste your money. Don't waste your money
10776,"A little bit of sex, a fair amount of drugs, but absolutely zero rock 'n roll.brbrI rate this one 1 out of 10, but would go to 0 if I could. Or perhaps I wouldn't"
10777,"A very visceral experience for 2 hours, where 4 plot lines are connected through lots of watery blood, reams of dismembered body parts and innards"
10778,It's a mess!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
10779,"A very funny film. The violence is bad, the acting is bad. The random chicks wearing hardly anything is just to catch sexually-frustrated goth lads in."
10780,"This movie was made for fans of Dani (and Cradle of Filth). I am not one of them. I think he's just an imitator riding the black metal bandwagon (still, I'm generally not a fan of"
10781,"Cradle of Fear is a good movie, but it doesn't live up to its hype. brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr"
10782,"A ""B-Horror"" movie that's really just a Cradle of Filth Video ""Goth"" movie that's really just a ""B-Horror"" movie that's really just a ""Goth"" movie"
10783,"Don't waste your money on Cradle Of Filth's score or Alex Chandon's bad script writing, acting or visual effects, it's a waste of time!"
10784,"Not as good as the director's cut, not as bad as the non-director's cut, but not as good as the director's version"
10785,Don't waste your time or money on this movie. It's a waste of your time and money. It's a waste of your money. It's a waste of your money. It's a waste of your
10786,"It SURPRISINGLY had a plot! ;) I've seen movies with less plot (I don't wanna mention Asian movies but...). I thought the camera wasn't bad at all for a cheap movie like this, and also"
10787,"Not 'the best British gore film since hellraiser', but a decent homage to the Amicus stable of horror films from the 60's and 70's"
10788,"This is the worst film i've seen in a long time, and i'm glad i only rented it. I hope the real fans of this film would have to be sadistic and Gothic to care about it without taking in any CGI"
10789,"Not a gem - not even semi-precious. The cast is strange, also. But mostly, there are too many dumb and unnecessary plot devices. It simply doesn't come together like it should."
10790,"What's the deal with the ""Three's Company"" movie? Depends on who you ask! Depends on who you ask! Depends on who you ask! Depends on who you ask!"
10791,"Not as good as the show, but not as bad as I thought it would be. I'm not saying it was bad, but it wasn't."
10792,This was supposed to be a biography on the biography channel but it was void of everything that is normally / usually seen in one of their biographies. In fact I know just as much now about the programme as I did before I watched this film
10793,"The minute you give an 'art film' 1/10, you have people baying for your ignorant, half-ass-ed, artistically retarded blood"
10794,"Don't waste your time, don't waste your money, don't waste your time, don't waste your time, don't waste your time, don't waste your money, don't waste your time"
10795,"""Magnolia"" is a preposterous, bewildering acting showcase that adds up to very little. Like ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" ""Magnolia"" is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence. Where is the reason"
10796,Great cast. Great acting. Unpredictable story line for the first halfbrbrhour or so. I was really wanting to know what was going tobrbrhappen to each of these unredeeming characters...
10797,"I was waiting for the big moment where all the stories inter connect and then suddenly..it rains frog?? it was if the writer said ""i've gone to deep how can i pull all these stories together cleverely....Oh so"
10798,I wanted to like Magnolia. The plot reminded me of Grand Canyon (which I liked) but Magnolia took a wrong turn halfway through the movie and I was lost. I almost turned it off right then and there but I felt I should hang
10799,"Don't waste your money on this one, if you don't want to waste your time and money on this one, don't waste your money on this one, if you don't want to waste your time and money"

10802,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long, long time. I've seen it more times than I've seen it. I've seen it more times than I've seen it."
10803,"I'm not a total philistine, I didn't hate the movie because it wasn't enough like 'police academy 9' or whatever, I enjoy more than my fair share of high brow or arty stuff"
10804,One of the worst films I've seen in a long time.........
10805,"One of the worst films I've seen in a long, long time! I can't say it's the worst, but I can't say it's the worst!"
10806,"Not as good as Charlotte Bronte's original novel, but not as bad as it could have been......"
10807,"Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood, but William Hurt's weary, throwaway acting style is completely unsuitable to the bold passion of Edward Rochester and poor Charlotte Gainsbrough looks like a bored, petulant teenager"
10808,"Zefferelli's attempt to adapt Charlotte Bront's novel 'Jane Eyre' is a total waste of time. The script is lacking in finesse and power, everything explained to the viewer in no uncertain terms."
10809,Jane Eyre is one of the greatest novels in the English language and this screenwriter should of read it. I hate it when writers use Spark notes for what a novel is all about. This movie is unbearable to watch if you have read the book
10810,"The BBC-version is excellent, but the BBC-version is worse. No, back to the BBC-version. This is story about love and passion, but I couldn't see it in this version."
10811,"What was Franco Zeffirelli thinking? Was Hollywood responsible for this travesty, or can I take comfort in the idea that someone who didn't speak English as a first language just completely missed the point of Charlotte Bronte's classic?"
10812,Not as good as the book but not as bad as I thought it would be.<n>I'm sorry to say it but I didn't really enjoy this version
10813,"Disappointing adaptation of Bronte's novel, but not as bad as it could have been. See ""Jane Eyre"" (1970) with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton for an outstanding production."
10814,One of the worst Jane Eyres I've ever seen - and it's not just because it's William Hurt's Rochester. It's the worst adaptation I've ever seen.
10815,"Just what I needed,another movie about 19th century England. Which is pretty much like regular England,only nobody's vandalising football stadiums.In this picturesque setting of lords,dames and other randomly chosen titles,Charlotte Gains"
10816,"One of the worst versions of ""Jane Eyre"" I have ever seen. I didn't care about Jane or Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Gainsbourg was almost tolerable and certainly looked the plain part, but she had no emotion in any"
10817,Where was the tension between Jane and Rochester? Where was the sparkle of the child who flirted and danced like her mother? Why was the plot changed at the end?
10818,"The first half of this version was the best I've seen (and I think I've seen every version of Jane Eyre ever made). Then, it was as though someone said ""Uh oh, this is running too long"""
10819,What a pathetic movie. I won't waste much time commenting about it. I'm still trying to get back the couple hours I wasted on...
10820,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it in my life.
10821,One of the worst movies I've ever seen; I'd rather see Capra in Free Willy (equally horrible) twice before ever seeing this movie
10822,This is the worst film I have ever seen.I was watching this film with some friends and after 40 minutes we had enough.The plot was bad and there wasn't a single likeable character.I could get more entertainment watching static
10823,"the book version is better than the movie, but this time it's over soon. At least with the movie it's over soon.brbrThe acting in this is terrible, which i expected from a film with Shaq"
10824,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen, and it's not just because it's so bad. It's because it's so bad."
10825,Shaq is the worst actor i have ever seen in a movie..he is the worst actor i have ever seen in a movie. Dennis Rodman is the worst actor i have ever seen in a movie.
10826,"The best parts were Shaq's outfits. The worst parts were, well, just about everything else. My 12 year old son and I just squirmed and couldn't look at the screen when Shaq started rapping and we kept wondering why"
10827,Why did they make this in the first place?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10828,"shaq sucks at rapping, and i guess thats it.brbrI highly recommend this movie for college kids sitting around drinking some beers with their close friends and are in serious need of a good laugh."
10829,The worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I'd give it 4 stars if I could.............
10830,Don't waste your time and money on this movie. It's a waste of your time and money. Don't waste your time and money on this movie. Don't waste your money on this movie.
10831,"What was the point of this movie? What was the plot? I do not know. Shaq can't act, people don't know how to direct, and I am Kazaam!"
10832,"This movie is so, so, so horrible, that it makes angels lose their wings. Shaq had tried to make other crossover efforts, like his work in Shaq-Fu for the NES and his plethora of unbearable rap albums"
10833,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long, long time, and it's all about Shaquille O'Neill. He's the reason to watch it."
10834,"It's so bad it's funny, it's so bad it's so bad it's sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks"
10835,"This film proves that the ""commercial"" cinema is in a serious crisis.There is absolutely no reason that this movie should have been produced apart from the fact that somebody expected success based on Shaquille's name."
10836,This movie was not even entertaining on a stupid level. In this movie shaq plays a genie who lives in a boom box is that not orginal a genie in a boom box instead of a lamp. He is supposed to help a little
10837,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's the worst movie I've ever seen. It's the worst movie I've ever seen.
10838,"Not as good as Hedwig &amp; the Angry Inch, but not as bad as Velvet Goldmine, either...."
10839,"this is the worst movie i've ever seen in my entire life. i don't know how but i beared to watch this thing for an hour or so, and i definitely recommend you don't do so."
10840,"Banyo, Banyo, Banyo, Banyo, Banyo, Banyo, Banyo, Banyo, Banyo, Banyo, Banyo"
10841,"I am not a huge fan of contemporary Turkish cinema, which is because, the usual pattern of creating a box office success is by hitting below the waistline. This movie is nothing of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos, as the director"
10842,"Not much of Alt&#305;oklar's work is shown in this movie. To much nudity and sex centered jokes seems to show that Alt&#305;oklar had fallen for the famous saying which is ""sex"
10843,"I mean ultra light. This film features four giant stars, about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond that.brbrThere really isn't too much to say about this stinker, other than that although it has a"
10844,"It's the worst movie I've ever seen, and it's not just because it's a Julia Roberts movie. It's the worst movie I've ever seen."
10845,"The worst film I've seen in a long, long time.........."
10846,"So much potential, yet so painful to sit through. There isn't a single aspect of this thing that doesn't suck. Even Julia's fat suit is lame"
10847,"What a waste of a cast! I swear, the audience (1/2 full) laughed TWICE in 90 minutes. This is not a lie. Do not even rent it."
10848,The worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I've seen a lot of bad movies with big actors in it. But this movie was terrible. I have yet to see why people thought it was funny.
10849,the only scenes wich made me laugh where the ones with christopher walken in it(the crazy filmdirector)the rest of the movie was just boring.
10850,It never was. I'm not sure why Billy Crystal wanted to recreate a 1940s screwball comedy. What a vacuous shambles!..
10851,"Billy Crystal and the rest of the cast don't bring any smile to my face. I say it's a waste of my time. They call it comedy, I say it's a waste of my time."
10852,"What a dissapointment! I found this film to be an utter dissapointment! I was completely let down by a film with plenty of good ideas, and at the same time completely unwilling to explore or elaborate on any of"
10853,"A good movie, but not one you'd want to watch over and over again......."
10854,Shame on Julia Roberts and John Cusack. They are so talented and should not have had any part in this movie. The storyline was dumb and predictable. The jokes were not funny. I was all too happy when this movie ended.
10855,"Not what you'd expect from Billy Crystal and Julia Roberts, but it's not what you'd expect from a romantic comedy, either. It's not what you'd expect from Billy Crystal and Julia Roberts."
10856,"This movie is horrible! It rivals ""Ishtar"" in the number of embarrassingly bad moments. I would have rated it lower than a 3, save for a couple of funny lines; but, overall, this film was crap!"
10857,"What a stinkeroo this turned out to be!!! At one time, much earlier in her career, Linda Darnell was one of my favorites - no great shakes as an Actress, but..."
10858,"One of those movies that you watch just to see how much worse it can get. Frankly, I don't know how much lower the bar can go."
10859,"The worst movie I've seen in a long time, and I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once."
10860,One of the funniest kids movies I've seen in a long time.........
10861,House Of Villains is a despicable display of cartoon crossovers that make absolutely no sense at all. Some signs of the total disregard for previous films in this are: The voices don't even remotely match up and Iago is evil again (

10871,"This ""film"" is the culmination of everything that is bad about modern film. (is that a word? well, it's just been invented by I, Robot.)"
10872,"It could have been great, but it's less than the sum of its parts, mainly due to the utterly predictable plot that could have come from any action film of the last forty years"
10873,"The worst film I have seen in a long time, and I don't mean just because it's a bad movie. It's a bad movie."

10903,I've never found Margaret Atwood's books easy to read. This movie continues that fine Canadian tradition. It isn't easy to watch. Maybe the trendy folks at the chi chi Toronto cocktail parties will pretend they liked it.

10918,The Electra I read was far more manipulative and always seems to have a plan. She usually used others to do her dirty work and more often than not some sort of double cross was involved.

10939,"What were they thinking at ""Cannes""? One of the most irritating, films of all time. And to think I passed up ""Tumbleweeds"" to see this over-hyped film of boredom"

10943,"This movie is so bad, it makes Plan 9 look like Citizen Kane. I recommend that you watch this movie only if you are either a congenital idiot or very, very stoned."
10944,"This is a really bad film, with bad acting and a very boring pace, Lorenzo Lamas is really cool though!, however it is not enough, not recommended"
10945,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time, but it's worth it for Lorenzo Lamas and Josie Bell's laughs."
10946,I wish i could give the movie -10 stars but 1 is as low as it goes. Seriously i think someone was playing a joke on me when i saw this it cant be real......

10949,What was up with the janitor in Heaven scene? Is it really a funny gag to see a fat guy eating donuts and falling down over and over?
10950,"Halestorm is getting worse and worse with every new entry. The concept for this movie sounded so funny. How could you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors. But trust me when I say this, things went wrong"
10951,"I wanted to like this film, I really did. It's got some good actors but ultimately it falls flat. It tries too hard to be funny in some places..."
10952,I've never been a huge fan of Mormon films. I've always felt that the humor was too exclusive to the LDS community and made us seem like a bunch of obsessive wackos.

10962,"I'm at this very moment debating whether I should even finish watching this ""poppycock"" of a movie. They had a pretty interesting idea, with the buried movie set, and that was it. So far this incomprehensible mess"
10963,Sands of Oblivion could have been a lot more if someone had written a decent script for it. What disappoints me is this could have been a lot more if someone had written a decent script for it.
10964,One of the worst films I've seen in a long time.brbrThe question is were the filmmakers serious or kidding when they made this film?
10965,"This is a typical SciFi movie nowadays. Bad to awful acting, a script that is poorly written, and shoddy direction. I was sorely disappointed that Morena Baccarin decided to do a film of such low quality."

10971,"For outsiders, with no vested interests, it did not make much sense. The Germans were portrayed as incompetents and the Russians as heroes. How a young woman could 'love' the lieutenant from just glimpsing him was nonsense."

10975,What a waste of time and money!                    
10976,I hated this movie so much I remember it vividly. It is not even funny. It is not even funny. Any movie that relies on unfunny sex jokes and racism humor does not deserve the money it costs to...

10982,"Don't waste your time, you'll be bored by the end. I'll give it 3 stars, but it's not worth it."
10983,"Disappointed in this movie, no more than 3 votes for this one. Worth no more than 3 votes highly unrecommended for anyone not wanting to waste 2 hours of their lives."
10984,This is not Schneider's best movie but it's not his worst one either. So watch it for the monkey style Rob Schneider but it is definitely not one of the best comedies ever or one of the best movies that Schneider appears in
10985,This is the worst film I've ever seen. I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it in my life.
10986,"It's like Voodoo Academy takes the genres of horror, zombie, and gay movies, puts them in a grinder, then runs them through a coffee filter--only instead of it being the kind of coffee filter that filters out coffee beans"
10987,"It's campy, but it's not all that campy in reality. (It's not all that campy in reality. With the exception of Kevin Kalisher and Huntley Ritter, who don't take themselves"
10988,"Cheap and mind-blisteringly dull story and acting. Not a single good line, not even a line bad enough to be good, and no memorable delivery. Even the blooper reel included with the DVD showed how inept the actors"
10989,Touchy feely but no action. A cult movie is written on the box. Does that mean that this film is not to be watched at all???
10990,The worst movie i've ever seen in my life!! I don't know what these people were thinking when they made this movie!! I didn't even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie
10991,voodoo academy is the absolute worst film i've ever seen... and i'm not just saying that because i've seen it with my friends.

10993,"""Voodoo Academy"" features an ""Academy"" like no other, one that houses only six male students in one bedroom. These teenage guys are instructed in religion by a sinister young priest, who enjoys tormenting and comforting them simultaneously."
10994,One of those movies that should have been way better than it turned out to be. I dread to think what the Blockbuster-approved edit must have looked like

10997,"I thought that this movie was pretty lame. If you're looking for cheesey, you may like this. I, myself, don't mind a fair amount of cheese, but this was ridiculous"
10998,Worst movie I have seen since Gingerale Afternoon. I suppose that this is a horror/comedy. I pretty much predicted every scene in this movie. I believe that I could come up with as good of effects from what I have lying around
10999,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story does nearly not exist. The characters are full of stereotypes and the Special-FX only make you laugh.

11003,Not even my favorite horror babe Adrienne Barbeau can save this stupid teen horror flick from itself. I'm glad she takes care of herself since we don't get to see too much of her nowadays.
11004,I don't have words to describe the visual effects. Music is completely out of the story and I don't have words to describe the visual effects.

11008,"What more can I say? The acting was, almost without exception, amateurish. The directing and continuity were pitiful. The sceenplay was predictable down to the very last scene and the dialog was tedious."
11009,This is a very cheaply made werewolf flick. The video is dark and poorly lit. The audio is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed. [filled of course with silver bullets]
11010,"The worst movie I've seen in a long, long time.........."
11011,"Noam Chomsky at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.<n>Will Pascoe fails utterly in this effort, cobbling together uninspired snippets of Chomsky's wisdom from a visit to McMaster University in Hamilton."

11016,"I'm not sure what Diane Silver was thinking when she was making this movie, but it obviously had nothing to do with Richard Wright's novel, which the movie is based on."
11017,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it's based on a book--it's because it's so bad."
11018,"I don't care how drunk you are, you will react to 1200F degree flame. But they really milked that scene...it was comical. I'll tell you what though, I had great satisfaction in seeing Elizabeth McGovern burn"
11019,"This film could be voted for as a good film. However, it is spoiled for two reasons and both of these reasons in relation make this film simply disgusting."
11020,"Is this the same Kim Ki Duk who directed the poignant, life-spanning testimonial of ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring""? I just cannot seem to find him in this film"
11021,"I'll say this much--This director is all about RAW images...things most of us are not ready to confront head-on. Images of sex, suicide, murder, and people ""relieving themselves"" are constantly bombarding the"

11028,"""High Art"" had to have the most relentlessly depressing interiors since ""Seven"". One can almost forgive Sheedy and Mitchell for the cliché of going to a B&B for their First Time."
11029,"I was never so bored in my life. It's like watching lizards molt. Even the sex scenes will induce a serious case of narcolepsy. If you have insomnia, rent this."
11030,"Unwatchable, but the best part of the film is June Haver's beautiful costumes and great body. The best part of the film, to me, is June Haver's beautiful costumes and great body."

11041,"Not as good as i thought it would be, but at least it's not as bad as i thought it would be......"
11042,"""Midnight Meat Train"" is a somewhat intriguing and definitely haunting film, but not without defaults. It's not intended for easily offended viewers, but maybe people looking for plot coherence and clarity should leave it alone as well."

11050,Is Hollywood so much in need of a black hero that they need to bend the truth in all of their bio pics to make them believable? (Heres a suggestion How about Denzel playing a movie about himself? Now thats inspirational)
11051,"A Hollywood version of a true story that is still left to be told truthfully.<n>Denzel's acting is stale, and the supporting cast's Mickey Mouse attitudes are annoying"
11052,"Denzel is about the only thing that is right in this movie. Maybe once in an early stage this was a better movie. Someone decided to cut some action and plot points into the beginning of the movie, giving away most of the story line"

11058,"The life and times of champion boxer Mike Tyson. Reverent, though scrupulously fair. Given his conviction on a rape charge, the film is careful not to portray him as hero or villain."
11059,"A very ordinary made-for-tv product, ""Tyson"" attempts to be a serious biopic while stretching the moments of angst for effect, fast forwarding through the esoterics of the corrupt sport of boxing"
11060,"It was interesting at start but it didn't convince me as a whole. I am no Tyson fan. In fact I don't like boxing at all. It's barbaric, obscene and double faced (by society) that some"
11061,It's kind of hilarious if you watch this. We have a typical family filled with cliched characters (father a war veteran who lost his wife and blames himself LOLOL) air-head children trying to hard to fill the stereotype

11074,I felt cheated after seeing this picture. It felt like I sat watching this movie 101 minutes for nothing. I don't understand what they were thinking when they made this. It hardly gets into Jeffrey Dahmer murdering and it has no ending

11084,"""Dahmer"" is an interesting film although I wouldn't use ""horror"" or ""thriller"" do describe it. It's more a minor character study that seems oddly sympathetic of the killer."

11105,This show is a total crudpie! Jim Belushi has all the comedic delivery of a hairy lighthouse foghorn. The women are physically attractive but too Stepford-is to elicit any real feeling from the viewer.
11106,I love the episode where Jim becomes the Greenman. It is great! I am attempting to find a certain photo from that episode. Does anyone know where I can download a photo of Jim as the Greenman?

11283,"This documentary has so many problems that I hardly know what to say. I am not a Muslim, nor am I an Islamic studies expert, but I know enough to shed some light on the obvious one-sided viewpoint that this documentary espouses"
11284,What the West NEEDS to know is this is nothing more than propaganda aimed at mental midgets. If you are looking for an actual documentary on Islam and the current state of the Middle-East I would look elsewhere. Try something...
11285,This video contains an outsmart way to confuse and manipulate Americans about Islam. It's a pity that the people who did it really believe that American people is so dumb to believe in it.
11286,"I hope many people are exposed to Muslims who live all over the U.S., U.k, and all over the world. The religion has over a billion followers."
11287,This film was more effective in persuading me of a Zionist conspiracy than a Muslim one. I'm Jewish. And I'm Jewish. And I'm...
11288,Don't waste your time and money; just turn on your AM radio and listen to Rush Limbaugh for a couple of days for free and you'll get the same message with the same level of intellectual analysis
11289,One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time..........
11290,This is a very sad movie. Really. Nothing happens in this movie. The Script is bad!!! I guess they've just copy-paste the first 15 pages to 90 pages.
11291,"Good first ten minutes, but then it repeats itself. Not even good acting, it just goes on and on. Altogether, that makes 12 good minutes."
11292,"This movie was advertised on radio, television, magazines, etc. Almost every hour or every issue. So when we went to the Kinnepolis multiplex our expectations were very high. But oh boy, how sad this movie is!"
11293,The worst animated film I've seen in a LONG TIME. That's saying something since I have taken my son to see every animated release for the last 4 years now.
11294,"It is pretty surreal what these flies can do... eh well... this is a cartoon, so anything can happen in it. I guess it was written for 6 year old kids."
11295,"Okay, so, someone, somewhere, a few years ago, thought it would be a good idea to make a 3D IMAX movie about some flies stowing away aboard the Apollo 11 and going to the moon."
11296,"Good animation, bad plot, bad plot, bad plot, bad plot, bad plot, bad plot, bad plot, bad plot, bad plot, bad plot, bad plot, bad plot, bad plot, bad plot, bad plot,"
11297,"Cute, but not as good as I thought it would be.........."
11298,"It's about Flies, for krissakes! Flies with big, googy human eyes, true, but flies nonetheless. This one's got even less empathy going for it."
11299,"Not a good movie. Too preachy in parts and the story line was sub par. The 3D was OK, but not superb. I almost fell asleep in this movie."
11300,"Not as good as I thought it would be, but still fun for kids to watch......."
11301,One of the worst children's movies I've ever seen..........
11302,"A 3D ""disgrace"" to the world of 3D animation..!                "
11303,this is what you would get if you allowed a 10 year old (manic American) to write a story of a moon trip. Absolute garbage with no redeeming qualities
11304,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen, kids or no kids. It's aimed at toddlers (or it better be - it's insulting to the intelligence of anyone over 3), but I've never seen something so"
11305,"There's a Donald Duck cartoon in 3d. I remember specifically, a Donald Duck cartoon with Chip and Dale in it. I don't remember the name at the moment, but the plot was that Donald worked at a circus,"
11306,"Shrek 3d was not the first 3d animated movie. It was a motion simulator at Universal Studios. They should still consider it as a movie, because it appeared in a ""theater"" and you could buy it for DVD."
11307,What the hell's going on? I'll just mention one of the more fright ones in passing. Who paid for Domergue's fare from somewhere in Asia to New York?
11308,"Not as good as Cat People, but not as bad as Lewton's or Tourneur's....."
11309,"Faith Domergue is the only reason to watch this film. The story is very thin, and once the Air Force buddies return to the States with a Cobra Curse upon them the action is just a waiting game."
11310,"I mean the word ""pedestrian"". Seems the producers forgot to have anything interesting happen. Faith Domergue can do better than this. She is supposed to be the mysterious, vengeful Cobra goddess torn by love for Marshall Thompson (there'"
11311,"Not as good as the first, but not as bad as the 2nd or the 3rd, but not as bad as the 2nd or the 3rd"
11312,"Unspectacular sequel to the classic animated classic 101 Dalmatians.' Yes, the movie continues where it ended in the first one, but the problem is that it plays out much like the original."
11313,"I should explain why i gave this...""piece of art"" 1 star rating out of possible 10. Simply because it's hard or next to impossible to rate it unbiased."
11314,"Fellini's worst work to date, but Bukowski's best work........"
11315,"One of the most bizarre films ever made - even for Fellini. About the only one more bizarre is his SATYRICON. This is a two and a half hour romp through a strange nightmarish world of decadence, opulence and sexual challenge"
11316,I can't stand some of Fellini's films...and I'm not just saying that because I'm a fan of his movies!
11317,"Spike Lee's ""Blues"" doesn't even offer a mild buzz. This Spike Lee Joint doesn't even offer a mild buzz. It's some pretty bad homegrown"
11318,"Spike Lee is a genius, but Mo' Better Blues is a waste of time, money, and talent......"
11319,"It's a comic book story, but that's pretty much what it is. It challenges none of our prejudices. It reaffirms out belief that the world can be divided into Good and Evil. What I'm waiting for --"
11320,"I was a bit underwhelmed by the predictability and simplicity of the film. Maybe the conflict I had was that from the time the movie was filmed to now, the plot of a man falling for beautiful women and eventually falling for the good girl has"
11321,"How blasphemous IS this film? I mean, how blasphemous IS this film? This is a disgrace and another excellent example of the secular-progressive bigotry of the film business, worldwide (not just Hollywood)"
11322,Don't waste your time and money on this movie. It's a waste of your time and money. Don't waste your time and money on this movie. It's a waste of your money.
11323,"One of the worst films I've seen in a long, long time........."
11324,"George Stevens Sr. ""epic"" of miscastings and misreadings, I submit that then-studio obeisances to bankable box office ""giants"" came a cropper of its own 'gigantismoses"
11325,"""Giant"" is one of the most boring, overly-long Hollywood contraptions ever. Many scenes seem utterly fake and without energy. Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor, and James Dean are wasted in this big Hollywood production."
11326,This was before she got so fat but she still looked very short and dumpy. Rock Hudson was OK as Bick Benedict but clearly an actor with more range like William Holden would have been better. James Dean certainly proved he knew how to
11327,Don't expect anything more than to be mildly amused for a few hours.brbrJust don't expect anything more than to be...
11328,"Not quite as good as ""Cyborg"" and ""Nemsis"", but still a good action flick....."
11329,"Not Albert Pyun's best work, but it's better than ""Nemesis"" (and it's better than ""Knights"")"
11330,Cyborg Gabriel (Kris Kristofferson) is programmed to destroy Jb (Lance Henriksen) in this high-speed adventure. Also stars Gary Daniels (as David) and Scott Paulin (as Simon)
11331,"""Jesus, this looks like an Albert Pyun flick"". Wasn't quite sure, though, for two main reasons: the photography was quite good..."
11332,"This movie will promote the improvement of the mind. Read a book! I've seen ""B"" movies before but the ""C"" movie has just been invented. I didn't think I would ever enjoy Power Rangers since my kids"
11333,"Drivel, drivel, drivel drivel drivel drivel drivel drivel drivel drivel drivel drivel drivel drivel drivel drivel drivel drivel drivel drivel drivel drivel drivel"
11334,Not even good enough to be called a sci-fi movie. Not even good enough to be called a sci-fi movie. Not even good enough to be called a sci-fi movie.
11335,this is truly awful... makes jean Claude's cyborg look like gone with the wind... this is an hour I wish I could sue to get back... luckily it produced severe somnolence...
11336,Kris Kristofferson as a cyborg warrior? Who the hell thought this was a good idea on paper? I'd give it 4 stars if I could?
11337,One of the worst films I've ever seen in my life.. and I've seen it more than once........
11338,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time, but it's worth it for the scenic shots of the westerns. It's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
11339,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time, but it gave me a lot of laughter, if you're in need of it."
11340,"Still a sucker for Pyun's esthetic sense, I liked this movie, though the ""unfinished"" ending was a let-down. As usual, Pyun develops a warped sense of humour and Kathy Long's fights are extremely impressive"
11341,One of the worst movies I've ever seen in a long time!brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
11342,it doesn't help rohmer's case that a few years later Syberberg came along and made a staggeringly great piece of work on the same subject (with a little help from Wagner).
11343,"This movie falls flat on all levels. It combines elements of theater, film, and epic storytelling. Unfortunately, it falls flat on all levels. The films biggest weakness is it's unwillingness to commit to anything; it has camp, moral"
11344,"Good to know Ben's still alive & kicking! How 'bout a remake of Creature, but 50 years older! Ugly then, uglier now! Good to know Ben's still alive & kicking!"
11345,"What we get instead is a tedious and ridiculously simplistic documentary that attempts to show how animals are ""human"". The filmmakers search high & low for footage of animals engaged in human-like behaviour, and when it happens they say, ""That monkey"
11346,"How come Mariska Hargitay never speaks in the TV version, and not in the B-movie? Is this why she never speaks in the TV version?"
11347,"Get your brews out and enjoy this flawed action flick. Speakman's considerable kempo skill (nice spin kicks, decent with the sticks - poor couch!) is the only redeeming quality of a movie that just cries bad acting."
11348,The Perfectly Stupid Weapon. I think the guys dancing at the beginning of one of Steven Segal's movies was intented to mock Jeff doing his forms to dance music at the beginning of this stupid movie.
11349,"""Challenge to Lassie"" revisits several earlier Lassie situations; and, it does not improve upon them. Comparatively speaking, this one is sloppy and unexciting."
11350,"This is a very bad western mainly because it is historically inaccurate. It looks as if it were shot on a back lot in California instead of where Jack Slade lived and died, Idaho, Colorado Territories, and Montana."
11351,"A Knight of the Trails (8/20/15) William S. Hart  William S. Hart, Leona Hutton, Frank Borzage, W. Sloane Carey"
11352,"Universal is running out of ideas. Most of the budget was probably spent on Lon Chaney Jr. to star as Kharis, the Mummy.brbrHow much longer can this madness continue?"
11353,"Not as good as ""The Mummy's Hand"" or ""The Mummy's Bloodbath"" or ""The Mummy's Bloodbath"" or ""The Mummy's Bloodbath"" or ""The Mummy's Bloodbath"""
11354,"Poor script, poor direction, poor acting, poor acting, poor acting, poor direction, poor acting, poor script, poor direction, poor acting, poor direction."
11355,The 3rd Universal mummy movie is about the same as the first two as far as the final result from the viewer's perspective. The story is similar and the results are ho-hum.
11356,"Not as good as ""The Mummy's Hand"", but not as bad as ""The Mummy's"", but not as bad as ""The Mummy's"""
11357,"This is a direct sequel to 'The Mummy's Hand' (1940), because the lead character, Stephen Banning (played by Dick Foran) is now thirty years older and is..."
11358,SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
11359,"""Nightmares"" is a dreadful piece of exploitative horror cinema, but hey, at least I gave you a golden tip to make it more digestible."
11360,It's okay to disobey authority figures and do what you think is right. Far be it from me to determine how a message has to be delivered so long as the right one is.
11361,This is the worst Black Stallion movie I've ever seen...and I'm not talking about the first one...I'm talking about this one..
11362,This movie was a real torture fest to sit through. Its first mistake is treating nuclear power as so self-evidently a 'bad thing' that it barely needs to convince the audience of it.
11363,Wilde and his merry men must find a way to take themselves off the menu so they can begin excavation of an old Spanish galleon filled with gold bullion.
11364,"What a dreadful movie. Dodgy camera work, a script with more corn than Kellogg's, and acting so hammy you could open a pig farm with it."
11365,"The worst movie of all time. Even Yaphet Kotto could not save this turkey. I have heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled ""The Treasure"" but was changed to ""Sharks' Treasure"" in order to"
11366,"It's the same old formula, but it's a little more interesting than the Highlander series......"
11367,"Why do they all have to display the value set of 21st century America? I have read on the message boards of disclaimers that ""little was known"" of the dark ages. Not so. Considerable amounts are known, with much"
11368,This is a film that had a lot to live down to.<n>on the year of its release legendary film critic Barry Norman considered it the worst film of the year
11369,Where do you begin with a movie as bad as this?brbrNo. You just say that anyone who pays money to see a film as poor as this needs their head looking at. I respect those poor guys who saw it
11370,This is the worst film I've ever seen. I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it in my life.
11371,"This is the worst film I've seen in a long, long time........"
11372,"Rancid Aluminium was a complete waste of two hours, the plot line was thin and confusing, the prestigious line up of players had some terrible dialogue and extremely questionable accents."
11373,"It's the best film of the century, but now it's just a guarantee of a turkey every time it's on DVD          "
11374,"""50 Dollars..you Drink and Talk"", but I felt that my Polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing Russian accent than I could, so I declined to take this speaking part on."
11375,Don't waste your time and money on this film. It's a waste of your time and money. Don't waste your time and money on this film.
11376,This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life! I can't believe I'm writing this review! I can't believe I'm writing it!
11377,"one of the worst films i've seen in a long, long time.. and i've seen it many times.. and i've seen it many times.. and i've seen it many times.."
11378,Don't waste your time and money on this movie! Don't waste your time and money on this movie! Don't waste your time and money on this movie!
11379,This is the worst film I have ever seen - and it's not just because my brother Eddie appeared in it as the second 'heavy' in the pub scene.
11380,"Not the worst film ive ever seen, that honour goes to the truly pathetic used bogroll of a movie' (I use the term loosely)"
11381,I can't believe I wasted my money on this when I could have given it to a homeless person or a busker or a busker or SOMETHING!
11382,"Horrible script, annoyingly hectic camera, awfully edited, gruesomely badly acted. Only Rhys Ifans tries to fill his role with life. Another painful proof that ""different"" sometimes equals ""dreck."""
11383,"The first film I had to walk out on. And it was the cast and crew pre-screening (Not that I was involved, I hasten to add)"
11384,A waste of time. The premise was not too bad. But one workable idea (interaction between realmen and Russian mafia) is not followed by an intelligent script.
11385,"I have seen bad films but this took the p***. Made no sense, and all the characters do is swear every couple of seconds, oh and i think one has a low sperm count. Its that good."
11386,One of the worst howlers I've seen in a long time.........
11387,I was hoping that this film was going to be at least watchable. The plot was weak to say the least. I was expecting a lot more considering the cast line up (I wonder if any of them will include this on their CV
11388,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long, long time........."
11389,What the hell is the point of it all?..?...?...?...?...?...?...?...?...?......
11390,"Rancid Aluminium: for sadists, wastrels, and regressives only who want to torture themselves. I sincerely hope all involved in the film are hanged for this atrocity."
11391,"A real mess of a film from start to finish. Even if you ignore the dodgy accents, low production values and appalling camera work this film has absolutely nothing going for it. I only went to see it as I had read the book and"
11392,This is the dumbest movie I've ever seen -- and I LOVE James Garner. This is one of the 10 worst movies I have ever seen -- and I LOVE James Garner.
11393,"One of the worst films I've seen in a long, long time, and it's Madonna's fault! She's at her very worst!"
11394,"I really wanted to like this movie because the critics have been unkindbrbrto it (to say the least)... but it was terrible. Really terrible. Badlybrbracted, a witless script,"
11395,"Madonna can't act, can't be the star of any movie, can't let go of her own persona, can't let go, can't let go, can't let go, can't let"
11396,"Don't waste your time, money, or your money on this one...it's a waste of time...it's a waste of money...it's a waste of money...it's a waste of money..."

11400,Don't be fooled by the good reviews this movie has received. It's a waste of time..............
11401,It's not my fault. My girlfriend made me watch it. It's not my fault. It's not my fault. My girlfriend made me watch it.
11402,"Don't waste your money, don't waste your time, don't waste your money, don't waste your time, don't waste your money, don't waste your time, don't waste your money"
11403,"This remake of Lina Wertmuller's ""Blue Lagoon"" is a waste of time, money, and time....."
11404,"Guy Ritchie's noble effort is beaten up, knocked down, raped, kicked around, shot, stabbed, spit upon, punched, sodomized, and abused and left for dead by Madonna's dreadful performance"
11405,"This film story is bad enough, which can happen in real life. I'm very can not understand when they show us this bad film. I say it was bad because there is some reason."
11406,"This picture reminds me of a Keneth More picture from 1957 called The Admirable Crighton"" whilst on the boat he was a servant and upon being saved reverted back to servant."
11407,I can't believe I've seen this movie. I can't believe I've seen this movie. I can't believe I've seen this movie. I can't believe I've seen this movie.
11408,"Depressing, but not as bad as it could have been.........."
11409,"It's not a great movie, but, it's a good match for my tastes......."
11410,"A romanticised and thoroughly false vision of unemployment from a middle class ""artist"" with a comfortable upbringing... It is clear that the writer-director never suffered unemployment directly and certainly has no personal experience of it"
11411,"This move is slow, plodding, cold, dark, and without a plot or hope. It follows that tried and true European formula that they love to subsidize, that is never seen, but that the critics think makes an ""important point""."
11412,Gadar is a really dumb movie.It's too unrealistic and is a typical sunny deol movie that is aimed to bash Pakistan.The movie's aim is to misguide the viewers so they can think that Pakistan and it'

11416,One of the lamest movies we watched in the last few months with a predictable plot line and pretty bad acting (mainly from the supporting characters). The interview with Hugh Laurie on the DVD was actually more rewarding than the film itself...
11417,"A decent movie, but needs a little more running time to establish a couple of characters and a female lead capable of meeting the demands of her role."
11418,"Strtebeker is the worst TV mini-series ever made on this planet. The acting is unbearable and the historic background is mostly nonsense. Just two examples: Visby was shown as a village of three houses. Instead, it"
11419,Don't watch - it's a diabolic waste of time! Advice: Do NOT watch - it's a diabolic waste of time!
11420,This is a fascinating film--especially to old movie buffs and historians (I am both)...and I can understand a person liking the film despite its many problems.
11421,"Laura Harris is one of the better actors on the HBO hit series ""Dead Like Me"" and this series is only a low-budget reminder of what she can simply state about her time on the show"
11422,"It's interesting to see at least one picture that not only takes place before the time of Caesar and Christ, but is set when Rome was only one city among many on the Italian peninsula"
11423,"It's hard to imagine that anyone could find this short their favorite if they have seen most of their shorts, but I know that humor is VERY subjective. I have seen all of their sound shorts (by far the best of their stuff"

11425,"One of the best ending's I've ever seen, even if I didn't know it at the time I was watching it. I'll tell ya, it scared the little kid that I was."
11426,"It's a classic case of too little too late, but it's a classic case of too little too late. What saves the movie is how it changes tack and its revelation at the end."
11427,"So far I'm fascinated by the story, but the people in it, let it down, I just hope it gets better by the end, as I can't not not know what it's all about"
11428,One of the worst films I've ever seen. I've never seen anything like it. I've been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in New Zealand.
11429,Don't waste your time and money on this one.. it's a waste of money.. it's a waste of time.. it's a waste of money..
11430,Why didn't they get Ed Asner instead of people who go to the same church as the producers? And why did the protagonist throw the wise old sage character to the ground when he was never in danger?
11431,"It's as predictable as it gets's, and really a waste of time, you gain nothing by watching this, other than some weird laughs, because it's all so corny"
11432,"This film deserves another bad review. Consider one reviewer extolling the film's virtues that include 'no sex, violence or gore.' Uh, excuse me."
11433,"I'm stunned that the reviewers @ IMDb gave this TV film as a high a rating as they did. It's an innocuous, sweet, uncomplicated cliché' of a film that had two big names from the past in it (both"

11440,"Is it a coincidence that Orca was made two years after Jaws? Orca isn't exactly a ""Jaws rip off"" but it is obvious that it tried to profit from Jaws's success"
11441,A Jaws rip-off which doesn't even come close to being as bad as Jaws: The Revenge (although it's not as bad as Jaws)
11442,"Not Richard Harris's finest hour, but not really bad either. Bo Derek, as one of Harris's crew has a particularly unpleasant run in with the Orca and most of the supporting cast don't fare very well either."
11443,I don't know who got the idea that orcas go around killing people and bashing and destroying things for revenge but my god is it absurd. Orcas are most definitely not the cold-blooded killer this movie makes them out to be
11444,One for completists of the man.vs. beast cycle from the late 70s. Most will come away from the film shaking their heads in disbelief and grinding their teeth with despair.
11445,"""If you see an orca whale, ever, anywhere, run the other way cause if you step on his FIN the wrong way, he will hunt you to the ends of the earth destroying everything around you."""
11446,One of the worst pictures I ever paid money to see. Without a doubt. This is one of the worst pictures I ever paid money to see. I can still smell the rotting fish that constitute this story line.
11447,"This is the kind of movie that is so bad that if you paid 50 cents to see it, you would feel like demanding your money back. This is the kind of movie that is so bad that if you paid 50 cents to see it"
11448,"Better than Jaws, better than Orca. Better than Jaws. Better than Orca. Better than Jaws. Better than Orca. Better than Jaws. Better than Jaws. Better than Orca. Better than Jaws."
11449,It's hard to like this movie when its so implausible and silly AND tries to take itself seriously all at the same time. Like in a really posh kind of way.
11450,Please do not waste +/- 2 hours of your life watching this movie - just don't. Especially if someone is fortunate to be snoozing at the side of you.

11742,What waste of talent and money. Wish I would've waited for this movie to come on DVD because at least I wouldn't be out $9. The movie totally misses the mark. What could have been a GREAT movie for all actors

11744,"It's not a ""thriller."" Neither is it ""gripping, taut."" It might have been so based on the script, but the direction's slow pace makes it difficult to get into."

11969,'Porky's Poor Fish' is a so-so cartoon populated by appalling puns and one or two nice moments. Laughs are scarce and the cartoon is just about saved by Clampett's energetic direction.

11978,"""Visitor Q"" is NOT an art film in any respect. It has no content, no plot, nothing to it at all. It's just banal horror piled onto another. It's ""just in the film"""
11979,"This movie stinks. I don't think I have ever seen a movie so strung up on shock value. The plot was relatively interesting, but the dialog was super flat and the acting was bland. This could have been an a good movie"

12314,Objectionable and sick rape film. This movie was advertised as an important drama dealing with rape. What it is. It purports to be sympathetic to the victim of the rape but shoves the scene in our face.

12385,This is the worst detective programme i've ever seen. Its so depressing and dreary. I cant stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless. What happened to detective programmes with real mystery???
12386,"I am sorry to fans of this film but it is the worst thing i have ever seen. Slow,badly cast and badly acted it is a film trying to escape the deadbeat romcoms of the recent years and failing!"
12387,"It's not very funny. Martin, Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman squeeze a couple of laughs out through sheer effort, but they're all better than this and it's quite painful watching them work with such thin material"

12391,"A mini-genre based on the notion of American cleverness in the midst of an inflexible military machine. Sometimes that machine was non-US military, for example in prisoner of war situations."
12392,"I'm not some old fogey from the Baby Boom generation that grew up glued to a flickering b/w picture of Phil Silvers, Jackie Gleason etc."
12393,"Steve Martin should quit trying to do remakes of classic comedy. He absolutely does not fit this part. Like the woeful remake of the Out Of Towners, this movie falls flat on it's face."

12483,"This is the worst ripoff of Home Alone movies that I have EVER seen! Watch part 1 and 2, but don't let anyone say that this is BETTER than the first two!"
12484,"This movie was a disaster waiting to happen, and it is an embarrassment to Hollywood. For example, this kid's remote control race car goes all over the neighborhood, and even enters this house. It's even covered in clothes."
12485,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long, long time........."
12486,"Why did this film have to be made? I am the kind of person who believes even terrible movies are not wastes of time, but rather learning experiences."
12487,"I loved the first two movies, but this movie was just a waste of time and money (for me and the studio). I'm still wondering why they made this horrible movie."
12488,Don't even bother to watch it on t.v.! It's a waste of time and money! Don't even bother to watch it on t.v.!
12489,"Same plot, same kid, same villains, same plot, same plot, same plot, same plot, same plot, same plot, same plot, same plot, same plot, same plot, same plot, same plot, same plot,"
12490,"I don't know what you guys are inhaling, but please stop. This movie was complete trash. Its a crappy sequel rip-off with more unrealistic traps and a stupid new character kid that I wish the robbers would of at least beat"
12491,"If you want to laugh like crazy, rent Cage. It's about two war heroes, Billy and Scott who are best friends. When Billy is shot in Vietnam, he is unable to fend for himself, so Scott takes him in."
12492,"One of those low budget ""buddy"" action flicks that were produced during the 80's thanks in large part due to the films such as 48hrs. and Lethal Weapon"
12493,"One of the worst action movies I've ever seen. I've seen a lot of bad movies, but this is the worst I've ever seen."
12494,"""Deathrow Gameshow"" is cheesy, but it's a good time waster, especially if you're a fan of dark humor.."
12495,"I was expecting a hidden gem. It was a hidden turd. I was thinking, ""Geez, I could do better than that and I'm a moron"". Don't believe the few good reviews. I was suckered in"
12496,Disgusting portrayal of kibbutz life and the people who live there                  
12497,"This is not a good film, not for the world, not for the Jews, not for the kibbutzim, not for the Israel of the 21st century."
12498,"It's not all black - just a wrong portrayal - probably on purpose too. Yes, and the acting was good too, so you see it wasn't all black - just a wrong portrayal - probably on purpose too."
12499,One of the best wrestling shows I've ever seen! I can't believe I've seen it on TV! I can't believe I've seen it!
12500,"Grim, but intriguing, and frightening. Grim, but intriguing, and frightening. Grim, but I'd have to say that The Third Man has a more well-crafted storyline."
12501,"One of the best thrillers I've seen in a long time. It's the most original movie I've seen in years. If you like unique thrillers that are influenced by film noir, then this is just the right cure for"
12502,"One of Von Trier's best, but the bomb scene is a bit of a letdown.<n>The train journey is like an allegory representing man's procession through life with all its trials and tribulations."
12503,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, too!"
12504,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time........"
12505,Zentropa (Europa) is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. I can't wait to see it again!
12506,A film to buy if you don't own already and one to see if you have not. A film to buy if you don't own already and one to see if you have not.
12507,"One of von Trier's best, but it's not quite as good as he'd like it to be. Where's the DVD?"
12508,"""I didn't know films could be made like that"" is the exclamation that came from a companion after the film ended: ""I didn't know films could be made like that"""
12509,"A bizarre, nostalgic, elaborate film about a naive American in Germany shortly following the end of WWII. The American, named Leo, doesn't fully get what he's doing there."
12510,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time........"
12511,"I've been foolishly procrastinating (not the right term, there's a long list!) to watch this film and finally had the chance to do so. And ""news"" are: Marvellous labyrinthine spectacle!"
12512,A piece of subtle art. Maybe a masterpiece. Doubtlessly a special story about the ambiguity of existence. Tale in Kafka style about impossibility of victory or surviving in a perpetual strange world.
12513,the movie was good but what was said already. all i wanted is to point the fact that the movie isnt from Sweden but from Denemark. Maybe I wrong and in that case i'll be happy to know my mistakes so take the
12514,"This film ""shook"" me when I first saw it. It left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days. brbrWhen asked about my favorite films, this is the one that I seem to always mention"
12515,EUROPA (ZENTROPA) is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the excitement that must have come with the birth of the narrative film nearly a century ago
12516,A beautiful painting about love and death. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The color... The music... Just perfect. A beautiful painting about love and death.
12517,"This is the definite Lars von Trier Movie, my favorite, I rank it higher than ""Breaking the waves"" or the latest ""Dancer in the Dark"""
12518,"This is the movie for those who believe cinema is the seventh art, not an entertainment business. Lars von Trier creates a noir atmosphere of post-war Germany utterly captivating. You get absorbed into the dream and you're let go only"
12519,One of the most visually stunning films I have ever seen. The blend of grayscale and colour photography is near seamless... a true feast for the eyes. The picture was a contender for a 1991's Golden Palm in Canners.
12520,One of the best films I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once.
12521,The first von Trier movie i've ever seen was breaking the waves. Sure a nice movie but it definitely stands in the shadow of europa.
12522,"One of the better ""shoot 'em out"" films I've seen in a long time......"
12523,"This was a good movie, the actors did a good job, the story was basic and the actors executed it well. I like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and that they did it all"
12524,A good action movie with good actors and actresses :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D
12525,"Still one of my favorite short/experimental films, and a creative inspiration for me as well... after all these years, I could finally see the film!"
12526,"One of the first art works to merge film and video in the context of the Star Gate sequence in 2001, released the same year. Pure abstraction isn't really my thing, but I can take it in small doses and the super-saturated"
12527,'OffOn' is the first true merging of film and video in avante-garde cinema               
12528,A Christmas Together--I've been raised on John Denver and the songs from this special were always my family's Christmas music. For years we had a crackling cassette made from a record that meant it was Christmas.
12529,"One of my all-time favorite Muppet specials. I'd love to see it again. It's part of my family's Christmas tradition now, and I would love to be able to actually see the show again rather than just"
12530,"a favorite Christmas Special that I wish that they would release on vhs or dvd, since my 33 RPM got lost,and any cassettes I made are also long gone"
12531,John Denver & The Muppets A Christmas Together - A Wonderful Christmas Show.<n>A DVD of this show would really be a good seller. If you don't have the CD it is a wonderful Chritmas collection of songs taken from
12532,i have a copy of it on VHS uncut in great condition that i transfered to DVD and if anyone one wants to bring back the memories of a Christmas classic please emil me...
12533,I love this Christmas special. I have the original vinyl album and CD. I have the original CD and later release. The later release is missing several songs though.
12534,One of the best Christmas shows I've ever had the pleasure of watching with my children...and I still buy the CD and DVD every year..
12535,"It's not supposed to be intellectually stimulating, it's a fun film to watch! Jesse and Chace are funny too, which is just gravy. Definitely worth a rental."
12536,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.. but it could have been a little longer.. I cant wait to see it..
12537,I thought the movie was OK...nothing really outstanding...I just was hoping that he would be a hardcore druggie and totally trash his life.brbr
12538,This movie made me feel like I was being sucked into something dangerous and I couldn't get out of it. I had no idea what this movie was about when I started it.
12539,"One of the best movies I have seen. The movie relates to real life and how drugs CAN play a major part. Although this movie appears to be produced from a low budget, I found it to be exhilarating to watch."
12540,"One of the best short films I have ever seen. I wish it was available now for people to see it. I only saw it once, in 1959 when it was originally released, but it has remained unforgettable."
12541,"I remember seeing this in a the Salem movie theater (where I used to attend ""Kiddie Matinée""s almost every Saturday) in Dayton, Ohio..."
12542,One of the best films I've ever seen -- and I've seen it again and again! I can't believe I haven't seen it!
12543,A great film for a religion class. It was a great discussion starter. I used this film in a religion class. It was a great discussion starter. I used this film in a religion class.
12544,"A charming, funny, and entertaining show, well-acted with wonderful characterizations.brbrI recently saw on DVD four old episodes PLUS the Reunion of 2000 with Richard Crenna, Kathy Nolan, and Tony Martinez."
12545,The Reunion Show was a real treat for me. I've watched it on DVD several times and have enjoyed it each time.brbr
12546,I want to find out what happened to Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (little Luke)!!! I have searched everywere and no luck.The only thing I could find out about Michael Winkelman is he was
12547,"I really enjoyed it a lot! I would have rated it a 10 if they had had ""Hassie"" and ""Little Luke"". They were very popular characters and I think it was a mistake not to give an explanation about their lack of"
12548,I loved The Real Mc Coys (1957-1963) It is too bad that Lydia Reed has decided to be forgotten and not appear. She was excellent in the show.
12549,"One of Vincent Price's best, but it's not available in the U.S. at this time......"
12550,HOUSE OF WAX and THE MAD MAGICIAN are both terrific 1950s horror films. They are both terrific 1950s horror films. Both were made in 3-D.
12551,"Price's follow-up to HOUSE OF WAX (1953) remains the superior effort; that said, apart from some resistible comic relief, the obligatory resort to cheap gimmickry"
12552,"Price at his best in ""The Mad Magician"", a classic from the 60's. A must-see for all Price fans. Price at his best."
12553,"""Never change a winning team"" is exactly what writer Crane Wilbur must have thought when he penned down Price's character Don Gallico. ""The Mad Magician"" is an amusing and thoroughly unpretentious 50's horror movie in Grand Guigno"
12554,"Vincent Price as an illusionist,John Emery as the Great Rinaldi.<n>Good solid B Movie melodrama.Shot in black and white it is low on gore and is enjoyed for the presence of its star giving an idiosyncratic"
12555,"Price's first movie on Turner Classic Movies, a must-see for Price fans brbr br br br br br br br br "
12556,The most believable movie I've seen in a long time! I couldn't have been more set back by the incredible job that they did I'd have to say its the most believable movie that I've seen in a long
12557,What a surprise; two outstanding performances by the lead actresses in this film. This is the best work Busy Phillips has ever done and the best from Erika Christensen since Traffic.
12558,One of the best anti-gun films I've seen in a long time - and it's not just because it's an anti-gun film
12559,"One of the most moving, disturbing, and disturbing movies I've ever seen!... and it's not just because it's a ""Star Wars"" movie!"
12560,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time..........
12561,"""Home Room"" came as a total surprise. It paid off big time because it doesn't hold any punches and what we see is how lives are changed by the act of a disgruntled young man who decided to victimize his class mates"
12562,One of the most powerful films i've seen in a long time. It's not just about a school shooting. Its about people and how they deal with tragedy. Its about people and how they deal with tragedy.
12563,"Busy Philipps, Erika Christensen, Victor Garber, and James Pickens Jr. shine in ""Home Room"", Paul F. Ryan's first full-length feature"
12564,This movie is so misunderstood it is not even funny. If you think of seeing this one for the shootings.. stay clear. This one deals with the effects and trauma that the survivors must endure. Even the detectives are seeking the answer we
12565,One of the greatest movies of all time. I can't think of a better movie to watch. I can't think of a better movie to watch.
12566,"One of the best films I've ever seen, and one of the best I've seen in a long, long time, and one of the best I've ever seen."
12567,"""I'm dying inside"" and ""I'm dying... I'm dying... I'm dying... I'm dying... I'm dying... I'm dying... I'm dying... I'm dying"
12568,One of the best movies i've seen in a long time. I can't believe it's not on DVD.....
12569,"Disturbing, Disturbing, Disturbing, Disturbing, Disturbing, Disturbing, Disturbing, Disturbing, Disturbing, Disturbing, Disturbing, Disturbing, Disturbing, Disturbing, Disturbing, Disturbing,"
12570,"One of the best movies I have ever seen! I have to say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen! I was bored and looked through the t.v. and found ""Home Room"" and it was"
12571,This is one of the most amazing stories I have ever seen. brbrThis is one of the few movies I have seen that was actually able to make me cry
12572,I loved this movie and was glad to see all of the positive comments about it. I couldn't even get through Elephant because it just seemed to be exploiting the Columbine tragedy.
12573,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, but it's not as good as I expected it to be...."
12574,Home Room is one of the best movies ever made about the Columbine High School shooting and the aftermath of the shooting.<n>The movie shows the power of closeness and turmoil after a school shooting.
12575,"One of the best movies I've ever seen, and one of the best movies I've ever seen, and one of the best movies I've ever seen."
12576,"Busy is so amazing! I just loved every word she has ever done- freaks and geeks, Dawson's creek, white chicks, the smokers. after the first time i saw home room i went and got it the next day."
12577,My children just happened to stop at this movie the other night and as things started to play out it really piqued my interest. I had to head out for bowling league so I had them record it for me on the dvr so I could
12578,"If you ""get it"", it's magnificent. If you don't, it's decent. Please understand that ""getting it"" does not necessarily mean you've gone through a school shooting."
12579,"One of those little known movies that plays only once on TV and than seems to vanishes into thin air. I was browsing through my old VHS Video collection and came across this title, I looked it up and it had an IMDb score of more"
12580,Busy Philipps deserves an Oscar for her performance in this movie..........
12581,One of the best independent films I've seen in a long time. I've seen it many times and loved it. I've shown it to 4 people so far and they have enjoyed it as well.
12582,Home Room was a great movie if you've ever had drama in your life. It keeps you wanting to see more. I think I watched that movie 6 times in a row and never lost interest.
12583,This movie is a must see for anyone who has ever been in a position to judge others or has ever been in a position to judge others. I was deeply moved by this movie.
12584,I liked this movie a lot. It really intrigued me how Deanna and Alicia became friends over such a tragedy. Alicia was just a troubled soul and Deanna was so happy just to see someone after being shot.
12585,"One hell of a performance by Busy Phillips. Erika Christensen was good but Busy stole the show. It was a nice touch after The Smokers, a movie starring Busy, which..."
12586,"""Who Done It?"" contains many surefire laughs and gags. It is not only one of the best Stooges films with Shemp, it is one of the finest short comedies Columbia produced."
12587,"""You will be next!"" You'll be next!"" You'll be next! You'll be next! You'll be next! You'll be next! You'll be next! You'll be next!"
12588,One of Shemp's first shorts with the Stooges. (This excludes his much earlier vaudeville years with the team.) But the threesome's comedic timing is at its honed best here.
12589,"One of the very best Three Stooges shorts ever. A spooky house full of evil guys and ""The Goon"" challenge the Alert Detective Agency's best men."
12590,One of the best short movies I've seen in a long time.........
12591,Another good Stooge short!Christine McIntyre is so lovely and evil and the same time in this one!She is such a great actress!The Stooges are very good and especially Shemp and Larry!This to is a good one to watch
12592,I loved it. Convoluted nonsense of course and unforgivable that such a complicated denouement should be rushed to the point of barely being able to read the subtitles
12593,One of the best Giallos I've seen in a long time - and it's not just Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfatti!
12594,"One of the best Giallos of the 1990s. A must-see for Giallo fans. A German-Italian coproduction, but not the one to look for."
12595,"Miraglia's second Giallo is a must see for fans of the genre!<n>A great combination of Giallo and Gothic horror, with plenty of red herrings thrown in!"
12596,"""La Notte Evelyn usc dalla Tomba"" is one of the best films I've ever seen. It's a must see!"
12597,"An old family story is brought to life 16 years later as he foretold. The color is superb in this thriller from Emilio Miraglia, who only did one other Giallo, as far as I know."
12598,"Miraglia's ""La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte"" - The Red Queen Kills Seven Times"" is a masterpiece!"
12599,"""The Red Queen Kills Seven Times"" is one of the best giallos of all-time, and one of the best of all-time!"
12600,"""The Red Queen Kills Seven Times"" is one of the best giallos I've ever seen, and it's out on DVD!"
12601,"One of the best children's movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time!"
12602,"Walken's acting makes it believable, but the singing and dancing is mediocre. But the story is great. My daughter was entranced. I loved watching Walken in this role thinking about what the future held for him."
12603,One of Walken's few musical roles to date. (he is a marvelous dancer and singer and he demonstrates his acrobatic skills as well - watch for the cartwheel!)
12604,"It's Christopher Freakin' Walken, doing a movie based on a fairy tale, and he sings and dances. His acting style fits the role very well as the devious, mischievous Puss who seems to get his master into"
12605,A classic fairy tale with Christopher Walken and Puss in Boots in the starring roles. I recommend this movie for children and adults who are a child at heart.
12606,A touching romance with a theme that stresses the importance of literacy in modern society and the devastating career and life consequences for any unfortunate individual lacking this vital skill.
12607,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a fan of Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro."
12608,"Not afraid to travel the darker roads of loneliness, failure, disappointment and sorrow. Each of these two people, as portrayed, have plenty of reasons to be bitter and angry, yet find tenderness and comfort in each the other."
12609,"Stanley and Iris is a heart warming film about two people who find each other and help one another overcome their problems in life. A really good film without nudity, violence, or profanity, that which is rare in today's films"
12610,Incongruous with all that has come before that I at least wonder if it wasn't forced in by some Studio exec suddenly worried about the lack of a feel-good ending
12611,"So-so romance/drama that has a nice ending and a generally nice feel to it. It's still a fairly mild, nice tale that I would be happy to recommend."
12612,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, even if it's not the best movie I've seen in a long time."
12613,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long, long time."
12614,"It's a ""decent"" movie, but it's a ""decent"" ""decent"" ""decent"" ""decent"" ""decent"" ""decent"" ""decent"" ""decent"" ""decent"" ""decent"" ""decent"" """
12615,Liked Stanley & Iris very much. Acting was very good. Story had a unique and interesting arrangement. Characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings.
12616,Liked Stanley & Iris very much. Acting was very good. Story had a unique and interesting arrangement. Characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings.
12617,A very well done special story of real people and real love - a must see for anyone who loves a story of real people and real love - this is a winner.
12618,"Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro are great, but it's a dull, dull movie......."
12619,Very good drama although it appeared to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves. I can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write.
12620,Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro are great in this movie. I haven't always been a fan of Fonda's work but here she is delicate and strong at the same time
12621,"Fair drama/love story movie that focuses on the lives of blue collar people finding new life thru new love.The acting here is good but the film fails in cinematography,screenplay,directing and editing.The story/script is only"
12622,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best scores I've ever seen. John Williams scores it."
12623,"A brilliant, darkly funny, deeply disturbing tale about love, sex, personal liberty, and revenge, a serious morality tale even more relevant now in a time when Congress wants to outlaw gay marriage..."
12624,"""All the world's a stage and its people actors in it""--or something like that. Who the hell said that theatre stopped at the orchestra pit--or even at the theatre door?"
12625,Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant!
12626,"Keisha, Natella and Latrina have given exploding sweets and behaved like bitches, I think Keisha is a good leader. There are also small stories going on with the teachers of the school"
12627,What a pity that it isn't! What a pity that it isn't! What a pity that it isn't! What a pity that it isn't!
12628,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best films I've seen in a long time!"
12629,"A nice addition to the documentary I once saw about Ned Kelly, but I guess that this might be the biggest problem this movie will have to face. No-one knows anything about it and probably not many people will care about the subject."
12630,The story of Ned Kelly has been enshrouded in myth and exaggeration for time out of hand.<n>Heath Ledger does an amazing job of impersonating Australia's most notorious outlaw.
12631,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once."
12632,"The Jerilderie Letter is more than what has been stated before. It is Ned's biography, an outline of what he stood for and who he was protecting. So go ahead and read it, watch the movie and then make up"
12633,"Not as accurate as I would have hoped, but still a solid Ned Kelly film. Ledgers performance in the title role is quite solid. Some location shooting film in the area I live, Bacchus Marsh outside Melbourne as well as Clunes &"
12634,"Ned Kelly looks like it is going to be a wonderful film. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I could not take my eyes away from it (it got my attention for sure)"
12635,"A wonderful film about a true Australian hero, and one of the greatest outlaws of all time, Ned Kelly. Heath Ledger, Orlando Bloom, and Joe Byrne give stellar performances."
12636,This movie shows that they were not killing for fun but to save the ones they loved! Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom did a great job portraying Ned and Joe. It has a few quick inappropriate scenes but is all right other than that.
12637,"Not as good as I thought it would be, but still a great story of Australia's history. brbr6/10 see it for historical value....(yeah right...and that's the only reason to see it"
12638,"It's not bad, but it's not very good. The editing is good; the film is well-paced. The story is competent and assured."
12639,"Heath Ledger as Ned Kelly is the real deal! I'm a Ned Kelly fan, and this is a great movie! I'm a Heath Ledger fan too!"
12640,One of the best films I have seen in a long time. Heath Ledger is terrific as the legendary outlaw Edward ''Ned'' Kelly. All action sequences are on point right up to the end.
12641,"This is a very good film, but why isn't it better in the cinemas? I don't know, but I thought it was very well made."
12642,"I'm tired of people judging films on their ""historical accuracy"". IT'S A MOVIE PEOPLE!! The writers and directors are supposed to put their own spin into the story!"
12643,"Fantastic movie. One to excite all 5 senses. Is not a true historical report and not all information is to be taken as factual information. True Hollywood conventions used, like playing A list and VERY attractive actors as the 'heroes'"
12644,"Give this movie a chance if it airs on cable. Otherwise, I don't think I could recommend it. Otherwise, I don't think I could recommend it."
12645,"One of the Best Movies of the Last 20 Years.. But Why Doesn't This Movie Get an ""R"" Rating?..?.?"
12646,This is a movie most people would like who enjoy seeing more true to life movies. this is a movie most people would like who enjoy seeing more true to life movies.
12647,"""The Amati Girls"" is such a movie. In old time movie theaters I would have stayed put for more showings. Was this story autobiographical for the writer/director? It has the aura of reality."
12648,"A wonderful movie! Anyone growing up in an Italian family will definitely see themselves in these characters. A good family movie with sadness, humor, and very good acting from all. You will enjoy this movie!!"
12649,"Anne DeSalvo, Lee Grant and Cloris Leachman make this a great family movie......."
12650,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time; no car chases, no car chases, no emotionalism, no emotionalism, no 'ax to grind'"
12651,"What a delightful movie. The characters were not only lively but alive, mirroring real every day life and strife within a family.brbrThe story has a true-to-life flow that the viewer can assimilate into and be part"

12653,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I'm a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The movie paints an accurate picture of the South and the racist attitudes.
12654,One of the Best Movie's I've Seen in a long time. I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once.
12655,"""Convicts"" is very much a third act sort of film. All the dialogue and character interaction that occurs within it comes out of the long wind-down of a late southern day."
12656,"Robert Duvall is a direct descendent of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, according the IMDb.com movie database. This is a ""real moment in time."" Life moves on, slowly, but ""strangers we do not remain."""
12657,One of the best films I've ever seen. Robert Duvall's performance was excellent and outstanding. He did a wonderful job of making a character really come to life.
12658,The first race film I really enjoyed and it helped introduce me to Oscar Micheaux. This movie was the first race film I really enjoyed and it helped introduced me to Oscar Micheaux.
12659,One of my favorite feel good movies. I first saw it when it as the Christmas attraction at Radio City Music Hall when it first came out and loved it ever since.
12660,"One of Neil Simon's best plays. Creaky, cranky ex-Vaudeville stars played by Walter Matthau and George Burns are teaming up for a TV comedy special. The problem is they haven't even SEEN each other"
12661,"One of the best buddy comedies of all time, right up there with ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles,"" ""Lethal Weapon,"" and ""The Hard Way"""
12662,"Walter Matthau deserves the Oscar for this film. His performance is amazing--given the fact that he was 20 years younger than his character, Willie Clark. His mannerisms are first-rate."

12674,Walter Matthau and George Burns just work so well together. The acidity of Willy with the perplexed amnesic Al is a mixture made in heaven. Watch for the scene near the end when Al and his daughter ask something of the Spanish caretaker
12675,"The Sunshine Boys is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long, long time! I've seen it many times, and I love it!"
12676,"A really funny film about a pair of ex-comedians trying to get back together after a long time away from each other. I think the best line is Burns mentioning that Matthau called him ""a son of a bitch bas"
12677,George Burns and Walter Matthau did a great job in this movie! I'm 14 and I'm a fan of George Burns and Walter Matthau!
12678,"I'm giving this film only 8 stars because overall this is NOT one of the best films ever made. Also, be warned that to enjoy the script you really need to appreciate Neil Simon's brilliance with finding the wit within real human"

12682,Marion Davies & William Haines at their best in this hilarious silent comedy. A must for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the still-maligned Davies!
12683,Davies & Haines are a wonderful team. A great lampoon on Hollywood and its pretensions. A must for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the still-maligned Marion Davies!
12684,"One of the best silent movies I've ever seen--and I'm a big fan of Marion Davies, too--a must-see!"
12685,It's so cool to watch a Silent Classic once in while! Director Vidor is simply delightful and even makes a lengthy (at least for 1928) cameo as himself.
12686,A delightful Hollywood satire that retains its charm. Watch the film today and you can see why. It's still funny and its satirical points still resonate.
12687,"A wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of Marion Davies. She is not only gorgeous but hilarious in this film. (I believe that Lucille Ball may have modeled her later career on Davies' style, that could be termed ""zany beauty"
12688,"""Show People"" is an absolutely delightful silent directed by King Vidor and starring Marion Davies and Billy Haines. What gems both of them are in this charming comedy about a young girl, Peggy Pepper, whose acting is the talk of Savannah trying"
12689,One of the funniest 'backstage at Hollywood' movies I've seen in a long time. Marion Davies should get a medal for bravery for taking a part where acting poorly in front of a camera is part of the role.
12690,"One of Davies' best, but it's a hokey satire of the 'good days'<n>Show People is a hokey satire of the 'good days' hence, it remains a highly entertaining example of work from MGM"
12691,"One of the best silent comedies of all time. I've seen it more than once, and I've seen it more than once, and I've seen it more than once, and I've seen it more than once"
12692,"One of the first films to have the unbilled cameo appearances of stars as themselves. You will get to see folks like Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Mae Murray, John Gilbert, Eleanor Boardman etc."
12693,"One of the best silent comedies I've seen in a long, long time - and it's not just because it's a Marion Davies film!!!"

12707,Hawn and Sarandon are the best two in this movie. BEWARE SPOILERS. This movie was okay. Goldie Hawn and Chris Sarandon were the best two in it.
12708,Goldie Hawn's butt injury pratfall is the funniest thing I've seen in a long time. I've seen it many times.
12709,"Sunny, a cocktail waitress in the D.C. area, is a bit dim, to put in mildly. She saves the life of a prominent Arab, by taking a bullet in the behind that was meant for the official."
12710,"Goldie Hawn is from Washington, but I digress. This is sort of a Mr. Smith goes to Washington type of movie, with some variations but the same premise."

12714,"Joan Crawford at her ""working girl makes good"" phase in 1930's New York.........."
12715,"This is one of Joan Crawford's best Talkies. It was the first Gable-Crawford pairing, and made it evident to MGM and to audiences..."
12716,"""Dance, Fools, Dance"" is an early Crawford-Gable vehicle from 1931. Crawford plays a Bonnie Jordan, a wealthy young woman whose life consists of parties, booze, and stripping off her clothes to jump from a yacht and go"
12717,This was the first movie that they made together and they would go on to make several more. Crawford stars a young rich girl who's father is wiped out in the stock market crash and there is nothing left for her and her brother.
12718,One of my favorite scenes is at the beginning when guests on a private yacht decide to take an impromptu swim - in their underwear! Rather risqué for 1931!
12719,"Don't say I didn't warn you, but your gonna laugh. Probably enough to hurt your stomach. Sure it's got some blood splattering, all in good fun though. So, it's got no budget,"
12720,One of the best films I've seen in a long time..........
12721,"One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen some of the actors before, but never in anything like this, one or two of them I think I've seen in commercials or in something somewhere"
12722,"Fun for the younger audience. Low budget, but very entertaining. No nudity, but lots of sexual implication, slapstick silliness...everything adolescents go for."
12723,A funny comedy from beginning to end! There are several hilarious scenes but it's also loaded with many subtle comedic moments which is what made the movie for me.
12724,"This was just another marvelous film of the Berlin Festival. But unlike ""Yes"", by Sally Potter, which I had seen some days before, where..."
12725,"It's very nice, how the highly improbable story of how the two girls (Timoteo/Hummer) meet, is again mirrored in another, even more improbable story, that the girls make up for a casting"

12730,An allegory about the effect of violence on the psyche. This film is an allegory about the effect of violence on the psyche. This film has a climax that is definitely not for the squeamish members of the viewing audience but it is logical as well

12735,"One of the most visually accomplished and haunting pictures one could ever see. The heightened drama, intensity and undertone of violence threatens on the the the melodramatic or farcical, yet never steps into it."
12736,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, but it's spoiled by the first part of the first one......."
12737,"It cannot end here! There are too many unanswered questions! I reached the end of this and I was almost shouting ""No, no, no, NO! It cannot end here!"""
12738,"Sequel to ""The Kingdom"" is bloodier and even more twisted. I only saw half (I was exhausted and couldn't sit through all 5 1/2 hours) but I loved what I saw."
12739,"A good sequel, but not as good as the first.. or as good as the first.. or as good as the first.. or as good as the first.."
12740,"A good sequel, but not quite as good as the first one. It has many of the same qualities as the first series. These two makes up a series you don't wanna miss."
12741,"Better than the first, but still not as good as the first one, but still a good one. Don t be surprised if there s a third."
12742,More eeriness and dark secrets released in the final parts of Lars Von Trier's fantastic horror satire The Kingdom... Much more is revealed and the ending just leaves you begging for more.

12744,"Is it possible to continue the story without Helmer and Drusse?...and I have some idea. I think Lars should make RIGET III a little bit different. Mayble little bit stupid, maybe not."
12745,A very underrated movie. I thought it was fun and interesting and worth a 7 at least. A lot of slick movies with higher scores and making big money at the box office are much less interesting.
12746,"Not bad for a film that was so bad it could've been better. It's not bad at all, but it could've been better."
12747,This is the final movie in the Puppet Master series. This is a great way for the series to end. I wish Puppet Master Vs. Demonic Toys would finally be made.
12748,"It was an excellent piece to the puppet series because this film showed all of the series, from one to seven. And this was about one woman trying to stop the new puppet master because I would have never guessed that the puppets would be in"
12749,"One of the greatest films of the 1990's, and needs to be released on DVD to live up to its status as one of the greatest films of all time."

12751,"Mysterious, mesmerizing, manipulative, noirish, haunting, beautiful, and ugly. These are some immediate, grandiose, descriptions that come to mind when thinking of Lars von Trier's 1991 masterpiece EUROPA"
12752,Max von Trier is one of the best directors I have ever seen. He is the pre-eminent film artist from Europe. He simply is Bergman or Fellini of our time. It is too bad the critics are too intrigued with themselves

12804,Why isn't this on DVD or VHS? I've been looking for it for years! I can't get it out of my mind!
12805,"It's very simple to qualify that movie: ""A PURE MASTERPIECE"". A second reason is that the poetry expressed by Homere in his poem is well given by the production."
12806,"A beautiful rendering of one of the western culture's defining texts. It's a pity it's not available in DVD, especially given the vastly inferior and cheesy adaptations of the Odyssey that one can find in video stores."

12824,"Xica has been by far, the best soap I have ever seen. Forget everything else :)GO XICA.. Hope you all like it as well"
12825,Xica has become my Heroine. I look up to the way she uses her power to help all who seek it. I love all the characters and have found that they can relate to many people now in this century.
12826,"XICA is the best soap opera EVER. We need it on DVD or broadcast on TV again. We need it on Azteca America right now, which is only available in Mexico or in the US by paid cable. We need it released"
12827,"""Xica da Silva"" is a gem within its kind. The slave that becomes queen by capturing the heart of the most powerful man in the village."
12828,"Rachel York's ""Lucy"" is the best Lucy movie I've seen in a long time - and I'm not just saying that because she looks like Lucy!"
12829,"A Good Retelling of Lucy & Desi's Life, But Some Misgivings! A Good Retelling of Lucy & Desi's ""I Love Lucy"""
12830,This movie was very good and told the story of the beloved Lucille Ball very well. I highly reccommend it. I did not know much about one of my favorite actresses
12831,An interesting look into the lives of Lucy & Desi... but not as good as I'd like it to be. I don't think I'll ever watch this again.
12832,"""They All Laughed"" is one of those little movies I am always recommending to friends seeking something out of the ordinary. It is firmly rooted in the screwball romance traditions of the past, but seems more contemporary."
12833,"I laughed and smiled all the time. Just as we all do at times. Go get it. I've just seen it again on tape, almost twenty years after..."
12834,"Peter Bogdanovich is in love with all the women in his picture--he reveres them--yet Audrey Hepburn is (naturally) put a notch above the others because, after all, she's the princess Bogdanovich probably fell"
12835,The title is a hope about life! You have to be happy and laugh as much as possible! You have to be happy and laugh as much as possible!
12836,One of my all-time favorite films. It's finally coming out on DVD on 10/17/06 - the film's 25th anniversary. I'm just thrilled that it's finally coming out on DVD.
12837,One of the best romantic movies I've seen in a long time.........
12838,"'They All Laughed' is a superb Peter Bogdanovich film that is finally getting the recognition it deserves, and why? their are many reasons the fact that it's set in new york which truly sets the tone, the fantastic soundtrack"
12839,"""They all laughed"" is very much a family affair.If you add the fact that B.Gazzara and Miss A.Hepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture it has the air of almost a private"
12840,"One of Peter Bogdonavich's best films, and the cast is terrific. The cast couldn't be better equipped to play this light but slightly bittersweet screwball comedy."
12841,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time. I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once."
12842,"It's the best movie I've seen in a long, long time, and I've seen it more than once. It's the best movie I've seen in a long, long time."
12843,"Sublimity is the way we have to reach for The Beauty. And sublimity is the stuff this film is made of. If not his best, it's my most loved of all Bogdanovich movies."
12844,"One of the few romantic comedies that doesn't seem to be a rip-off of something else, this is the high point of Bogdanovich's fertile after- ""success"" career"
12845,"A La Ronde like feel to the film quickly develops as guys from a detective agency (Ben Gazzara, John Ritter and Blaine Novak) persue, fall in and out of love with some of the most quirky and beautiful women seen"
12846,What could be more schlocky than the idea of private detectives getting involved with the women they're supposed to be spying on? And most of the dialogue as written is perfectly banal
12847,"Don't waste your time and money on this movie! It's a waste of time, money and money! Don't waste your time and money on this movie!"
12848,"Zombie Chronicles is a great low budget B-movie with a great zombie make-up and gore, the acting is bad but that's what makes it entertaining"
12849,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time for a good reason."
12850,"I love all of the movies by Michael Landon Jr. And Michael Landon Jr.'s casting of Dale Midkiff as ""Clark Davis""could not of been any better. Dale Midkiff has the ways to pull off this character"
12851,"This movie was so great! I and my friends all love the series, so it just goes to show that these movies draw attention to all age crowds."
12852,We loved the movie. My 9 year old son loved this movie too. He is a movie critic so for him to say this tells me something. Help bring back a time of values.
12853,Love Abiding Joy....I wish it would have shown more of the end instead of letting you just think it. This movie has a lot to do with Jeff....It is 6 years later so you know he will be interested in Girls.
12854,"PLEASE MAKE ALL 8 MOVIES. PLEASE MAKE ALL 8 MOVIES. I want to see the message, and watch the message that these books and now movies are here to portray. We don't get that enough anymore. AWESOME JOB!!!"
12855,the one and only season has just aired here in Australia and i thought it was absolutely brilliant! all the story lines are so good! and its a much more realistic view on teen and family life today.
12856,"""The Days"" is a typical family drama with a little catch - you must relate to the character's emotions in every way possible in order for you to truly appreciate the show."
12857,This is the scariest game I've ever played. It's not the average shoot-everything-that-moves kind of fps (which I usually don't care much for)
12858,"This game was really great and quite a challenge. It has a great, spooky story line and the graphics are also very good. I would recommend this game to all Horror fans and is very gripping from start to finish."
12859,One of the best First Person Shooters out there. Definitely one of the best fps out there. Definitely one of the best. Definitely one of the best. Definitely one of the best. Definitely one of the best. Definitely one of the
12860,This is one of the best games I have ever played in my life. I love it. I can't wait to play it over and over again.
12861,One of the best horror games of all time. I've never seen anything like it.. I've never seen anything like it.. I've never seen anything like it.. I've never seen anything like it
12862,"""Undying"" is an extraordinary first person shooter that deserves to be played by any horror or game fan. But sadly I have to report that there are some flaws."
12863,The best video game I've seen in a very long time.........
12864,One of the best horror films I've seen in a long time. Olivia Dunne does an outstanding job as the teenage girl. A great supporting role for Nick Mancuso as a hotel owner.
12865,"I still like Nick Mancuso, even though it's not quite as good as he'd like it to be -- but I can't say that I cared much about any of the characters."
12866,"It's hard to criticize anything that Mitzi Kapture does. She just radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress. That notwithstanding, yes, the plot was predictable."
12867,"Loved it but still have nightmares over the hotel manager.The movie, was presented well, with the choice of actors carrying their roles to reality of the writing. Many scenes gripped the imagination and created a nail biter."
12868,It's all about Mitzi! And didn't she look fantastic?! I love these Lifetime Sunday afternoon popcorn movies. This is like one of those nailbiters where they always go to commercial at the most annoying times.
12869,"Dedee Pfeiffer is the reason to see this movie, and most of it comes off as believable. This LMN Original Movie premiered last night. 10/10"
12870,One of the better TV mystery movies I've seen in a long time. Dedee was great. I'd definitely watch it agin or rent it if it ever comes to video.
12871,I loved Dedee Pfeiffer (is that spelled right?) in Cybil. Haven't seen her for awhile and forgot how much I missed her. I thought she did a great job in this
12872,"""Hickory Dickory Dock"" is a solid brain exercise, without being as mind-numbingly complicated as ""One, Two, Buckle My Shoe"""
12873,"Not one of Christie's best but a solid entry in the Poirot series though not one of the best..<n>The mouse motif was effective if a little overdone, the bones of the story are there although more emphasis is placed on"
12874,"A solid, but not spectacular, entry in the long running Poirot series. I appreciate how faithful the script is to Agatha Christie's original story."
12875,"A good Poirot mystery, but not as good as the ABC Murders, and not as good as One Two Buckle My Shoe, but still a good adaptation"
12876,"A strong Poirot/Suchet, television mystery selection. The characters were vivid and well-acted. Japp was nothing special but for me did not distract from story."
12877,"""The Divers"" is a really good movie, I'll give it a 7 or 8 out of 10 for the cinematography, plot and nazi elements."
12878,"One of the scariest movies I ve seen in a long time, but I m not sure I ve seen it like this before."
12879,"Wow! A Danish movie with this kind of content? I mean, the actors, the story, the pictures, the efx - everything was where it should be"
12880,"This is a very good movie, and it's in a class of its own. It's in a class of its own, yet it has an international potential."
12881,They Gave Him A Gun is a very curious film about war and the effects it has on some people. I think it's a lot better than he gave it credit.
12882,"The story of Jimmy Davis, Franchot Tone, a young man in a war zone with a gun, a gun, a gun, a gun, a gun, a gun, a gun, a gun, a gun, a gun!"
12883,"Not as good as I thought it would be, but not as bad as I thought it would be. I'm not saying it is brilliant, but I would venture to say that it is a good movie. I enjoyed it."
12884,My all time favourite film of all time and i want to see it again on DVD. i have had it on bought video for about 10 years and i want to obtain a DVD copy of it. David Niven is my all time favourite actor
12885,One of the best movies I've ever seen - and one of the best I've seen in a long time - and one of the best I've seen in a long time.
12886,"""Broken Bow"" takes us back to where it all began. Set 150 years in our future and 100 years before Kirk, Spock and McCoy. Broken Bow is in my opinion the best premier episode of any of the Treks, and I"
12887,"The First Episode of the First Season of ""Enterprise"" on DVD (Brazil: ""Broken Bow"", 2151, 2151, 2151, 2151, 2151, 2151, 2151, 2151, 2151,"
12888,"One of the best Star Trek TV shows since The Next Generation, and one of the best movies since Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.<n>Scott Bakula as Captain Jonathan Archer is a superb human being and his charm, wit"
12889,"A good start to the ""prequel"" to the original ""Star Trek"" series......."
12890,"A very good start. I was a bit surprised to find the machinery not quite so advanced: It should have been cruder, to match we saw in the original series"
12891,"Good, but not as good as DS9 or Voyager, but still a good start to the new series.<n>I'll get the nits out of the way first. But, overall it was solid Trek material and a good romp"
12892,"One of the best Treks I've seen in a long, long time. The crew were really good. Scott Bakula played a typical first time captain in deep space and his unpolished way of doing things was a refreshing change to the"
12893,"Star Trek: Enterprise is the best of the series, but there's a lot to be said for some of the negative statements made in this movie."
12894,THE BEST STAR TREK SERIES IN THE HISTORY OF THE SCI-FI SERIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
12895,"""Star Trek"" is back - ""Voyager"", nobody misses you! I can't think of anything I didn't like. sign me up for 10 seasons of this show."
12896,"One of the best episodes since Star Trek: The Next Generation, but it's a little short on ending, too much sexy scenes, but it's good."
12897,"Star Trek: Enterprise is what I was expecting for it's own right. It's a great show, but it's a little too short."
12898,One of the best Star Treks I've seen in a long time...and it's just as good as Voyager's Caretaker--if not better!
12899,"Enterprise is the entertainment, but it is also the forefront of Science Fiction and a positive outlook for tomorrow. With gratitude and respect Mr. Berman and Mr. Braga"
12900,"Not as good as TOS, but not as bad as it could have been........"
12901,"A ""down to earth""-kind of feel with darker and less ""plaggy"" scenography. It has a ""down to earth""-kind of feel with darker and less ""plaggy"" scenography."
12902,Star Trek: The Next Generation - The First Star Trek Series Premieres on TV!                
12903,"Star Trek: The Next Generation is a good movie, but it's not a great series, and it's not a great movie for those who don't like special effects."
12904,One of the funniest shows I've seen in a long time..........
12905,"One of Turturro's Best Performances in a Long Time.<n>Luzhin is a Genius with an Achilles heel, a flaw that can be exploited for his own personal gain at this very tournament."
12906,"I've heard it before - where? Ah, from Kubrick's ""Eyes Shut"" (track 2), 'got it just as I arrived at the door. It's ""Waltz No. 2 from Jazz Suite No"
12907,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time, and it's not just because it stars John Turturro and Emily Watson."
12908,"A movie of outstanding brilliance and a poignant and unusual love story, the Luzhin Defence charts the intense attraction between an eccentric genius and a woman of beauty, depth and character."
12909,"One of the best in-depth looks at the life of a chess Grandmaster, and Turturro and Watson add a whole non-mainstream, non-cliche feel to the film"
12910,"A good film, but too much of the novel and not enough of the filmmaker's craft shines through. It felt through most of the film that the characters just helped to push the narrative along. Marlene Gorris could perhaps have examined the"
12911,"If you love romance, period pieces, great acting, knockout scenery, or the fine art of motion picture creation, don't miss this one. You will be defenseless in resisting its multitude of charms."
12912,"an intelligent piece of work laid out properly and executed well,it achieves its objectives,unfortunately i doubt if there will be sequel,unfortunately i doubt if there will be"
12913,"This is a poem on film, wonderfully presented and photographed with sensitive artistry. It captures the atmosphere of the time and place perfectly. (Italy's lake district in the twenties.) It's a love story with a twist."
12914,One of the rare cases in which a movie and the novel on which it is based are both great. Maybe this is because Gorris' takes Nabokov's initial ideas and gives them a different interpretation.
12915,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and it's not just for the chess player. It's for the viewer."
12916,One of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen...........
12917,"Luzhin is shown winning the game with an illegal move. Despite the use of Jonathan Speelman as consultant chess expert, Luzhin is shown winning the game with an illegal move."
12918,"Chess is a very big sacrifice, and you can sometimes end up imbalanced in other areas of life. I suppose I am quite obsessed by chess, but hopefully not as much as the central character in this film."
12919,A Chess Player's Love Affair with a Woman at a Tournament..........
12920,"A wonderful love story, whose gloss of chess might make it appear cerebral.But in spite of its origins in a Nabakov story, it certainly is not.<n>The romantic elements and the sense of time and place beat the psychological analysis"
12921,"""The Luzhin Defence"" is one of my favorite genres ""sports romances""<n>The chess comes alive as a tough competition much more than in, say ""Searching for Bobby Fischer,"" in showing just how much hard mental work the game"
12922,"Great film. Certainly of the calibre of ""Beautiful Mind"" Great acting, photography, script and drama. I can't imagine anyone not being entranced by this film"
12923,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I can't believe I've seen it so many times. I've watched it over and over.
12924,"Emily Watson at her best in this slow, but satisfying movie. :) It's about a man's obsession with chess, and how his past is closely tied to his present."
12925,"A beautiful example of a severe psychic trauma, even a trauma. It not only explains the enormous difficulties those people have to cope wither, but even love is sometimes not enough."
12926,"Interesting, but the characters were rather flat and at times too extreme in their thoughts/behavior. More extreme than necessary. Also, I think something went wrong in the casting. John Turtorro doesn't really satisfy me playing a semi"
12927,"The Luzhin Defense gives Navokov honor, the complexity of his work in images is a world event not to be missed.<n>Nastasya is a great match, but feel its conclusion deserved more intensity"
12928,One of the few quality films of 2000 and definitely one of my best. The scenario is based on the novel by Vladimir Nabokov and the transfer to the big screen is absolutely brilliant.
12929,An excellent historical drama. Turturro is excellent as the tortured genius Luzhin and brilliantly portrays the character's manic affectations. Emily Watson is fine in her support role as the sensitive lover Natalia.
12930,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
12931,Emily Watson at her best as a mothering mothering mothering mothering mothering mothering mothering mothering mothering mothering mothering mothering mothering mothering mothering mothering mothering mothering mothering mothering mother
12932,"One of the best chess films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
12933,"An excellent film for those into period dramas, the auteur's euphemistic chess play metaphor for orgasmic delight is an indication of the subtle wit behind the film"
12934,It's your basic 'who done it?' thriller with sex and murder but it keeps you guessing right to the end. I like these kinds of movies and I certainly think this one meets the standard.
12935,"A wonderful new crime series, bringing together three old stalwarts of British television (Denis Waterman, James Bolam and Alun Armstrong) as retired detectives brought back to help clear up old cases, under the leadership of younger, career-focused Amanda"
12936,The best series of its type I've seen all year. I can't help thinking it's just my luck - a series I love gets 6 episodes (and more next year) and the constant stream of cookie-cutter cop
12937,"My wife and I absolutely loved the series and can't wait for the next one (hopefully there is a sequel!). I would love to know what the catchy song is called and who wrote it, maybe because I am ""old and grey"
12938,"One of the best shows I've seen in a long time, and I've seen it more than once. The title song is so catchy I can't get it out of my head."
12939,"A lovely, spirit-restoring movie. From the use of the actual villa that inspired Elizabeth Arngrim to write the novel in the 1920s to the inspired casting, every choice was perfectly right!"
12940,Why ISN'T this film on DVD? It deserves to live forever. It deserves to live forever. Why ISN'T this film on DVD? It deserves to live forever. It deserves to live forever. It deserves to live
12941,"The magic of the villa will remain with them...and you will find your outlook altered, for the better. A delightfully uplifting movie! A delightfully uplifting movie!"
12942,"""Enchanted April"" is an adult movie with no cussing, no sex, and no violence. One might think of it as ""the ultimate chick flick"", but I bet there are one or two enlightened men out there who"
12943,"Charming, enchanting, and heartwarming, ""Enchanted April"" is one of the best movies ever made and my eternal love. This little film is a diamond of highest quality"
12944,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
12945,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time - and I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once.
12946,"You'll find treasures in everyday life, from the least expected sources. All it takes is patience and a touch of enchantment. All it takes is patience and a touch of enchantment."
12947,One of the most beautiful movies I've seen in a long time. And I'm not referring only to the scenery. It's about two unhappy English housewives who decide to rent an Italian castle to take a break from their not
12948,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.........
12949,"One of my all time favourite films, ever. Just beautiful, full of human emotion, wit, humour, intelligence. The story grows, as does the lesson of life, just a wonderful film in so many ways"
12950,"One of the best feel good movies I've ever seen -- and I've seen it many times, too. You can't help but smile all through it -- except when you're crying happy tears!"
12951,"This is the kind of movie England can do in its sleep, and that's meaning it as a compliment. Because of the success of very British comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the..."
12952,What a gem of a film! How come it isn't more well known? How come it isn't more well known? How come it isn't more well known?
12953,"This is a growth movie. Every character is different and better at the end- and it's all because one woman knows that the place they have chosen is a ""tub of love"""
12954,"An exquisite film about the search for some bliss in everyday life. The pacing, the camera work, the emotion, the haunting musical score and the pure charm of this picture make it a must see."
12955,"My all-time favorite movie. Oscar-caliber work by everyone involved, both in front of and behind the camera. The screenplay is perfect, and works out the relationship between Lady Caroline and George Briggs in a completely satisfying way."
12956,The true measure of any fictional piece of work is whether or not the characters grow from their experiences and emerge from the experience altered in some significant way (note that this change need not be positive or beneficial) at the end
12957,One of my all-time favorite films...and one of my all-time favorite women's films...and one of my all-time favorite women's films!
12958,"Enchanted April is a masterpiece of conveying a message with few words. It has been one of my 10 favorite films since it came out. I continue to wait, albeit less patiently, for the film to come out in DVD format"
12959,I loved this movie. I absolutely loved this movie. I am not even sure what particularly about it but I think it was wonderful and should be available for DVD.
12960,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it's a film of a book. It's because it's a film of a book."
12961,"Nice character development in a pretty cool milieu. Being a male, I'm probably not qualified to totally understand it, but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive Victorian environment from the start."
12962,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long, long time!"
12963,"Josie Lawrence at her very best in this heartwarming and magical gem. I was very pleasantly surprised by this heartwarming and magical gem. It is uplifting, touching, andbrbrromantic without being sappy or sentimental. See it!"
12964,"An excellent movie, especially as a date movie during lousy weather. I like the movie's tone of the story, and anyway I like sentiment when it's well done."
12965,"Miranda Richardson and Joan Plowright stole the show. Very enjoyable film. I didn't go into it with very high expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the acting, the script, and the scenery."
12966,"""Enchanted April"" and ""The Enchanted Cottage"" are the only two movies I can think of about romance and mysticism. They both used wonderful actors not stars."
12967,A very good period piece 7 of 10 of 10 of a very good period piece 7 of 10 of 10 of a very good period piece 7 of 10 of a very good period piece 7 of 10 of a very good period piece 7 of 10
12968,"one of the best ensemble acted films I've ever seen. There isn't much to the plot, but the acting- incredible. You see the characters change ever so subtly, undr the influence of the rented villa in Italy,"
12969,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because Pat Boone's a bad boy. It's because it's April Love."
12970,"One of my all time favorites because my father, Nelson Malone plays the horse trainer. I remember distinctly when Hollywood came to Lexington, KY, where we were living at the time to make April Love."
12971,"I love this movie because I grew up around harness racing. Pat Boone behind the sulky reminds me of my father who was drawn to the trotters because, unlike thoroughbred jockeys..."
12972,One of the best horse movies of it's time. It is one of those great classics that the whole family can watch. The story line is interesting and the songs are great. Pat Boone and Shirley Jones are at their best.
12973,"DeMille at his most inaccurate and un-factual. It sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than Wild Bill Hickok, Buffalo Bill Cody, Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln"
12974,"""The Plainsman"" is an adventure film, but not a textbook on Lincoln's political ideas or his quotable legacy. But not as a textbook on Lincoln's political ideas or his quotable legacy."
12975,"Wild Bill Hickock, Buffalo Bill Cody, and Calamity Jane are the central characters.<n>Hickock, Cody, and Calamity Jane are the main characters."
12976,"One of the best Westerns of the 20th century, and one of the best of the 20th century, and one of the best of the 20th century"
12977,"A rip roaring western and i have watched it many times and it entertains on every level.The story moves with a cracking pace, and there is some great dialogue between Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur two very watchable stars who help to make"
12978,"Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill and General Custer all together. Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill and Jean Arthur plays Calamity Jane."
12979,"The Plainsman is an entertaining western, no doubt a classic, which is actual even today. Gary Cooper is Wild Bill Hickok, together with John Wayne and James Stewart, they were the best actors that played western heroes in their generation"
12980,"Cecil B. De Mille's Wild Bill Hickock,Buffalo Bill, and Jean Arthur go West. Very well done. A must see for De Mille fans."
12981,"One of Cecil B. deMille's best, but it's not the same today as it was in 1936-1945......."
12982,One of the best DeMille epics of the 20th century. Jean Arthur is excellent in this one. It's not historically accurate but it's great entertainment.
12983,Susan Sarandon's best performance in a long time. A must-see for anyone who has ever lived at the south pole. A must-see for anyone who has ever lived at the north pole.
12984,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time! I've watched it 8 times already! I've seen it over and over again!
12985,One of the best action films I've seen in a long time.........
12986,Legend of Zu is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. It transcends all expectations and is truly a work of art. Legend of Zu is on a level of greatness so high that perhaps many people are put
12987,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time! I'm a D&D fan, and this is the best movie I've seen in a long time!"

12989,this is one amazing movie!!!!! you have to realize that chinese folklore is complicated and philosophical. i myself did not understand everything but knowing chinese folklore (i studied them in school)it is very complicated. you just have to take what it gives
12990,"I've been a fan of Xu Ke (Hark Tsui) for many year since school. This film is the best fantasy movie in years. I dont think ""action"" is the right genre, though there's lot of"
12991,"This is like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" in a more surreal, fantasy setting with incredible special effects and computer generated imagery that would put Industrial Light and Magic to shame"
12992,A work of art from the beginning to the end...........
12993,Tsui Hark takes the Legend of Zu to a whole new level!!brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
12994,The Legend of ZU.....kicks a*s!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
12995,"An extraordinary vision of the future of the 7th art and the one of the most pioneering, astounding, rejoicing in the recent years. VITAL severe MASTERPIECE!"
12996,"The Asian Lord of the Rings: A high fantasy story, based in actual Chinese mythology. (I realize many critics have called this film plot-less, I think they probably have zero knowledge of Chinese mythology.)"
12997,"I'm stunt, I must admit I never saw a movie with such good story and none stop high special effect martial art fighting scene. If you like the fantastic genre, like me, you will be more than satisfied!"
12998,"Tsui Hark's ""Time & Tide"" ain't no Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, this ain't no Storm Riders, this ain't no Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"
12999,"One of Tsui Hark's best films, but it's not quite as good as the 'original', but it's still good."
13000,"One of Tsui Hark's best films, but it's not for the brain club. Maybe you should go see the latest from the Hollywood studio's no brain club, but if you are looking for something more."
13001,"Tsui Hark's ""Wu Xia"" is one of the best kung fu movies of all time. A must see for all martial arts fans."
13002,the best lord of the rings movie of all time! a must see for any lord of the rings fan! a must see for any special effects fan!
13003,"The Legend of Zu, as I saw it, was a very interesting story. I think many of the people who didn't like it were not seeing the underlying mythology behind the film"
13004,"""Zu:The warriors from magic mountain"" was and is an impressive classic! Tsui Hark's use of special effects was very creative and inventive. (He continued doing this in the Chinese Ghost Story trilogy and later productions.)"
13005,"""The legend of Zu"" is perfectly transparent. And I do like it. It tells us in images the story about the fight between light and darkness, the fight that is as old as humanity, and every one who is in search of"
13006,"A story to love, characters you cry with, and truly: a movie you never forget! -- Editors note: well, I think I must watch it right now again..."
13007,"One of the best movies to come out of Hong Kong, and one of the best fantasy movies to come out of the U.S. since Bored of the Rings"
13008,"Good movie, but too many characters and too much special effects! I wish there was a mini-series for this movie! I'd give it 5 stars!"
13009,"Tsui Hark's visual artistry is at its peek in this movie. Unfortunately the terrible acting by Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung (I felt the urge to strangle her while watching this, it's that bad :) made it"
13010,A film that can make you shed tears of sadness and tears of joy would be considered quite a step in the career of a common filmmaker. The color purple stands for the beauty of the fields and flowers surrounding these poor people.
13011,"Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, Margaret Avery, Willard Pugh, Rae Dawn Chong, Carl Anderson, Susan Beaubian, Margaret Avery, Carl Anderson"
13012,"One of the best shows to come along in a good long while. It may take a few episodes to really find it's legs, but Clubhouse is easily one of the best shows to come along in a good long while."
13013,This show deserves a chance to catch on and be seen. Hopefully it will stick around for a few seasons and we can watch Pete Young (Sumpter's character) learn and grow.
13014,This is the best show I have seen in a long time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

13016,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
13017,One of the best fantasy love stories I've seen in a long time..and Robert De Niro steals the show as the star of the show.
13018,"One of the best fairy tales I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it's written by Neil Gaiman. It's because it's written by Neil Gaiman."
13019,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time! HEL YES! See it in the theatre, I know I'll be going back for seconds!"
13020,One of the best fantasy movies I've seen in a long time. brbrI thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was drawn to its original plot (based on the Neil Gaiman novel which I am now looking to read) and
13021,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once.
13022,"It's not a masterpiece, but it can occupy the same kind of ground that something like The Princess Bride has (though I don't like it quite as much as the earlier film)"
13023,DeNiro's best performance in a long time! (A must see for DeNiro fans!) A new Princess Bride cult favorite that should stand the test of time!
13024,A refreshing fairy tale fantasy with an undercurrent of adult cynical wit that charms its way into the audience as well as a soundtrack that powerfully moves this fairy epic along
13025,"The power to dream is a wonderful thing. There's a saying, ""Not all dreamers achieve, but all achievers dream."" By exploring our imagination we shape our own futures. Or..."
13026,One of the top 5 movies I have ever seen and I can guarantee you will not regret the time or money spent watching this movie. It is easily one of the top 5 movies I have ever seen and I can guarantee that anyone with a
13027,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time... and it's not based on anything I've seen or read in the past 15 years."
13028,One of the best movies of the 2000's and the 1990's.........
13029,"One of the best fairy tale movies I've seen in a long, long time, and Michelle Pfeiffer steals the show as the evil witch in this one!"
13030,"A beautiful, heart-warming fairytale for all the family, with a heart of gold and more 'n smarts than is immediately apparent..."
13031,One of the best fairy tales I've seen in a long time. It stands up on it's own and stands up on it's own.
13032,"Charlie Cox, Claire Danes, Robert DeNiro, Michelle Pfeiffer, &amp; Ricky Gervais make this a must-see movie for fantasy fans!"
13033,"One of the best movies i've seen in a long, long time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
13034,"Good, but not as good as ""The Princess Bride"" or ""The Pirates of Penzance"" or ""The Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" or ""The Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"""
13035,It's the type of movie that will stick with fantasy-lovers for a long time.<n>The best part is DeNiro's performance as a gay pirate
13036,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time! I've seen it many times and it's still better than I ever thought it would be!
13037,"What a wonderful, fanciful movie ""Stardust"" is. It has the damsel in distress, the hero, the rogues, the obstacles, spells, charms, and even a touch of light-speed to make it quasi modern."
13038,the best movie i've seen in a long time - and i've seen it many times before........
13039,"The best fantasy/sci-fi film I've seen since ""Return of the King"" (not that I am comparing the two at all)!"
13040,"Who is responsible for creating/approving the trailer for this movie, and everyone who actually saw it (that I know) absolutely loved it... The advertising campaign is disgrace/disaster/blunder"
13041,One of the best movies i've seen in a long time.<n>Claire Danes steals the show as Yvaine and Cox as Victoria.
13042,One of the best films I've seen in a long time and one of the best fairytales I've seen in a long time...and one of the best I've seen in a long time.
13043,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it a few times, but never as good as this one."
13044,I loved this movie so much in part because I've been feeling down in the dumps and it's such a lovely little fairytale. Maybe I loved it so much in part because I've been feeling down in...
13045,"One of the best Saura movies I've seen in a long time. Ibéria is an even better Saura. I recommend it strongly to those who love good cinema, good dance, good music, good dance, great art"
13046,"If Saura hadn't done anything like this before, Iberia would be a milestone. Now it still deserves inclusion to honor a great director and a great cinematic conservator of Spanish culture"
13047,"Carlos Saura's brilliant interpretation of Isaac Albeniz' masterpiece Iberia Suite. At the approach of its centennial, Saura drew together an unprecedented wealth of talent from the Spanish performing arts community to create this quintessential love song to their homeland"
13048,"The music of Albeniz pervades this film. If you don't like subtitles, don't worry. The film is virtually wordless, though each scene carries a title of an Albeniz piece."
13049,"I feel like I was sitting in a small restaurant in Madrid, comfortably watching the dancers bang on a wooden plank over a delicious fruit cocktail. I don't know how I will be able to get a copy of this film in the US"
13050,I was surprised at the low rating this film got from viewers. I saw it one late night on TV and it hit the spot - I actually think it was back in 1989 when it first appeared. Yet I remember it pretty well...
13051,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time--and I've seen it more than once--and it's not on DVD."
13052,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, too."
13053,"I was the baby in the movie. :) I am 19 years old now. my parents took me to try out for the part, we lived in Texas at the time. I think I only made like 80 bucks for it, but i"
13054,"The best film on the battle of San Antonio, Texas in March 1836, was John Wayne's 1960 epic THE ALAMO. But, he did not properly handle the leader of the enemy forces, General Antonio De Santa Anna."
13055,"More realistic than earlier versions of the legendary stand against hopeless odds, though the one made after this went perhaps too far in humanizing the figures of Sam Houston, Bowie, Travis and Crockett"
13056,"The Alamo: Thirteen Days To Glory is the best Alamo story filmed I've seen. John Wayne's film is a good one if over-hyped, but it's a John Wayne film with the story redone to fill parameters of"
13057,"13 days to Glory is a good movie, but the cast is too old and the script is not well-written. Raul Julia does a fine job as General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna."
13058,"A unique concept for a game show, and one that has as yet never been seen again. But it was a unique concept for a game show, and one that has as yet never been seen again."
13059,I remember this game as a child. It was the greatest thing on. I'd draw hidden pictures on my blackboard and see if my family or friends could find it. I also remember winning wonderful cars (Pontiac or Oldsmobile) if

13061,"""A River Runs Through It"" is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Redford is the ""famdamily"" as he is always around."
13062,"A River Runs Through It is the story about all generations. Long before Dustin Hoffman's character got all wrapped up in the traps of modern suburbia, Norman Maclean and his brother Paul were facing the same crushing pressures of growing up as they tried"
13063,"A River Runs Through It, Redford's ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again and again. Given the material, Redford's ode to a simpler time and life is worth again and again."
13064,"One of the things that warmed my heart strings was that dry fly fishing was a major part of the scene. I have occasionally carried out my times of dry fly fishing, having tied my own flies, and being accompanied by my brother and my"
13065,"""A river runs through it"" is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. I've never seen a better one."
13066,One of the finest films made in the 1990s. Brad Pitt is simply superb as the errant son who rebels. Robert Redford creates a wonderful period piece from the days of speakeasies of the 1920s.
13067,"Excellent film dealing with the life of an old man as he looks back over the years. Starting around 1910, he reminisces about his boy and young adulthood; his family, friends, romances, etc. Very nostalgic piece with a bittersweet"
13068,"Fly-fishing represents life, a little.brbrThe movie is very well directed, it has a nice score and all of the actors are good."
13069,"it's not so much a point-counterpoint sorta deal; i just like to see what people say on the flipside.<n>i do want to address one thing. many people that hated it called it, to paraphrase, 'beautiful"
13070,A River Runs Through It is one of those movies that deserves to be seen in the theater so that the majesty of its cinematography can be truly appreciated. Brad Pitt gives a radiant performance and Tom Skerrit is powerful as the preacher father.
13071,A River Runs Through It is an all around great movie that is destined to be a classic. If you haven't seen this movie definitely watch it as soon as you can because it will stay with you forever.
13072,"One of the best movies I've ever seen, and I'm sorry I didn't see it more often. I'm sorry that more people didn't appreciate it."
13073,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time... and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time..
13074,"The Footage is extraordinary, mesmerizing at times. It also received an Oscar for best photography, and deservedly so. I have many movies in my film collection and several more I've seen..."
13075,"the best film i've seen in a long time,and i've seen it more than once,and i've seen it more than once."
13076,"Great drama with all the areas covered EXCEPT for screenlay which was too slow and should have shown more relevant scenes like Pitt's character interviewing the President,or Pitt getting murdered instead of just having it described to us"
13077,Robert Redford captures the majesty of the Montana wilderness in this acclaimed adaptation of Norman Macleans classic memoir. The film won an Academy Award for Best Cinematopghaphy in 1993.
13078,"""A River Runs Through It"" is the perfect name for this film (and Norman Maclean's novel). Life ebbs and flows like a river, and it has it's rough spots, but it is a wonderful trip."
13079,The role of Jess's brother is to provide a form of dramatic irony in the story. Craig Sheffer/Norman could have foreseen the troubles associated with living life to the full by looking at how Jess's brother turned out.
13080,One of the few movies that does a book justice. I strongly recommend anyone that has the chance to go to Montana to fish or be outdoors to do so. It is amazing. I can not think of anyone else that could play the role
13081,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, too."
13082,"A River Runs Through It is a touching movie narrated by the director, Robert Redford, playing the elderly Norman and reflecting on times long gone and people long dead."
13083,"Stewart is a thoughtful loner forced into violence by his need to get rid of the treacherous actions of a corrupt entrepreneur robbing local miners of their claims brbrIn this entertaining, beautiful Western, Stewart has two leading ladies to struggle with"
13084,One of the best westerns ever made. Jimmy Stewart and Anthony Mann teamed to do some of the best westerns ever made. The real star of the film however is the spectacular Canadian Rockies that serve as a backdrop for the story.
13085,One of Anthony Mann's best Westerns. The Far Country is a must-see for fans of the genre. James Stewart is the star of the show.
13086,"One of the best Stewart-Mann westerns of all time, and one of the best Stewart-Mann westerns of all time, with James Stewart."
13087,"Colorful western from Universal-International. Good Technicolor adventure from Universal-International. Also starring Corinne Calvet, Connie Gilchrist, and Walter Brennan as Stewart's sidekick."
13088,"One of Mann's best, but the film's DVD transfer is a disappointment...<n>The Far Country is one of Mann's best, but it's not as good as Night Passage..."
13089,"One of the best westerns I've seen in a long time, but it's mostly about Jeff Webster's relationship with Ronda Castle and John McIntire's role as Sheriff Gannon."
13090,"Stewart's ""I trust only myself"" attitude in ""Winchester '73""<n>McIntyre's ""Soapy Smith"" in ""Gold Rush"""
13091,Another good Mann flick thanks to the father/son combination of Walter Brennan and Jimmy Stewart. Brennan (Ben Tatum) is often the comedic conscience of either Stewart or Wayne (Red River/ Rio Bravo)
13092,"An intense, sprawling, rather dark story reminiscent of John Ford's ""The Searchers"" though not so brutal. James Stewart is surprisingly good as a dark, disengaged man who thinks he cares for no one but himself."
13093,Classic drama/action western with incredible cinematography that is well ahead of it's time(1954).Unique peek into the American NORTHT WEST pioneers is very educational and entertaining.This movie is very under rated because most people do not like to
13094,"One of the best westerns I've ever seen, but could have been filmed in Dawson City,Yukon, where the film is set. Anthony Mann could have made the most of the scenery."
13095,"One of the best westerns I've seen in a long time, and it's from the great director Anthony Mann, who's one of my all-time favorites!"
13096,"I was really surprised to see that this movie was released in the U.S. in Feb., 1955. I saw it in a ""first run"" theater in Washington, D.C. in March, 1958"
13097,"Like ""It's a Wonderful Life"", ""The Far Country"" is about non-involvement, but with James Stewart's ""wings"""
13098,Good western with many favorite old faces in the lineup. Good western with many favorite old faces in the lineup.<n>A trail boss winds up in the Yukon gold fields with a bad reputation and small chances of being able to return to the states
13099,"One of the best Westerns I've ever seen, and one of the best I've ever seen from Jimmy Stewart, and John McIntire."
13100,"The fourth of five westerns Anthony Mann did with James Stewart, this one involves a hard bitten cattleman named Jeff Webster who takes a cattle drive from Wyoming to Alaska, via Seattle."
13101,"One of the best Westerns I've ever seen, and it's not just because it stars Jimmy Stewart. It's because it's directed by Anthony Mann."
13102,"The Far Country is a fine western, indeed.Walter Brennan makes a terrific sidekick to Stewart.Ruth Roman is brilliant and Corinne Calvet's delightful.Jay C. Flippen is very good as Dawson Marshal Rube Morris."
13103,"One of James Stewart's better westerns. This movie was just as good as some of the other westerns made by Anthony Mann and James Stewart like Winchester '73 and The Naked Spur, and much better than Thunder Bay and Bend Of"
13104,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
13105,One of the Best Sequels I've Seen in a Long Time. One of the Best Movies I've Seen in a Long Time. One of the Best Sequels I've Seen in a Long Time.
13106,"Not as good as the first, but still fun to see Stanley back in action. brbrI'm giving it a 6 out of 10."
13107,"I loved this movie. It was almost the same as the first (cabin by the lake), only instead of just killing women, he kills men also. And the scenes are much more interesting."
13108,"This movie is the best horror movie, bar-none.I love how Stanley just dumps the women into the lake.Its a blend of horror, and drama..."
13109,"Not as good as the original, but better than the TV version. It's a good sequel, but not as good as the TV version. I'm not a fan of Brian Krause's character."

13114,A Matter of Life and Death is the best film I have ever seen - and it's just as good today as it was in the 60's
13115,"""A Matter of Life and Death"" is one of the best movies of all time. Waiting for the DVD release of this movie for so many years is, in itself, ""A Matter of Life and Death"""

13118,"I LOVE this movie. Director Michael Powell once stated that this was his favorite movie, and it is mine as well. Powell and Pressburger created a seemingly simple, superbly crafted story - the power of love against ""the powers that be"""

13124,"""A Matter of Life and Death"" is one of those films that defies it age, looking fresh inventive, even in this age where CGI would vamp up its artificial effects."
13125,One of the best British films ever made - and one of the best of all time........
13126,"My favourite movie of ALL time. It's got everything. Romance, poetry, emotion, religion, drama and very quirky.brbrI can never explain exactly why, but it hits all the right buttons and although I'"
13127,"One of the greatest movies of all time, and one of the best of the 20th century, and yet it's still not available on DVD!"
13128,"Why is this movie not in the 250 best? Michael Powell wrote, directed and produced this astonishing movie which is a real ""tour-de-force"""
13129,"A wonderful film by Powell and Pressburger, whose work I now want to explore more. The film is about what we perceive as real and what is real, and how the two can be so difficult to distinguish from one another."
13130,"One of the most original love stories I have seen for ages, especially for a war based (briefly) film. Probably one of the most original love stories I have seen for ages, especially for a war based (briefly) film"
13131,A wonderful film from beginning to end. Another triumph for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. MARIUS GORING is a delight as the heavenly messenger sent to Niven when his wartime death goes unreported due to an oversight.
13132,One of the best post-war British films I've ever seen. I've seen it over and over again. I've never forgotten it.
13133,One of the most beautiful films I've ever seen--and it's not in the U.S. yet.--it's one of the best I've ever seen!
13134,"One of the greatest war movies of all time, and one of the best of the 20th century........"
13135,"One of the few best films of all time. The change from Black and white to colour for the Heaven and Earth Sequences was Directorial excellence.brbrThe Plot is extremely clever, the complete film leaves you overwhelmed by all"
13136,A Matter of Life & Death is one of the best movies I've ever seen -- & I've seen it more than once. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen.
13137,"One of the best British films ever made, if not one of the best films ever made anywhere. This film works on so many levels. So why is it completely unavailable on tape, DVD"
13138,One of Roger Livesey's best performances in an early post-WWII film. brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
13139,"""Stairway to Heaven"" is one of the best movies I have ever seen - and I'm not talking about ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""African Queen"""
13140,"One of my favorite movies of all time. Beat Street, although not as ""authentic"" in some respects is guaranteed to tug the heart strings of anyone who takes pride in the culture of urban sample/DJ-based music and electro-club"

13145,"I enjoy watching people doing breakdance, especially if they do it as well as in the best scenes of this movie which takes you to a disco club called ""Roxy"""
13146,"BEAT STREET is the best hiphop film I've ever seen, but it's not the best of them all...C'mon, its a classic!!!"
13147,"Not as good as ""Breakin' 1&2"", but it's still a good movie. I'll keep it in my library."
13148,Beat Street is the best movie ever made about hip hop culture and life in NY in the 80's......
13149,"Just as Jackass, but a bit more extreme. I'm not a fan of Jackass, but I'm glad I saw this."
13150,"This is a show that has little taste or class. It's not recommended for those who are easily offended or grossed out. Now, these guys need to see a psychologist. Specially the Paco character."
13151,"Not Jackass's best, but better than Jackass's..and more interesting than Jackass's..and more entertaining than Jackass's.."
13152,"The more extreme, British version of Jackass in which the four boys (Pritchard, Dainton, Joycey and Pancho) go to great lengths to hurt and humiliate each other."
13153,"If you were there, you know...and love this film, as I do. Aching and tenderly done. A fine piece of captured femininity."

13195,"I love this movie. I also love the Ramones, so I am sorta biased to begin with in the first place. There isn't a lot of critical praise to give this film, either you like it or you don't."

13208,Dom Monaghan at his best in this little trippy horror film. It's a must have for anyone who loves him. I'm glad to have it in my collection.
13209,"Interesting, but not as good as I'd like it to be, but still worth a watch......."

13212,Insomniac's Nightmare is one of the best indies I've seen in a long time! Dominic Monaghan really steals the show as the insomniac!
13213,"An Insomniac's Nightmare is the story of a man's plunge into insanity. We find out interesting things about Jack near the end, and think that by the time the movie is over we will have a ""happily ever after"
13214,One of Dom Monaghan's best performances............
13215,An Insomniac's Nightmare is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time--and it's on DVD!
13216,What I thought was going to be a very different film was actually a very good one. I'll give it 9 out of 10 for going far beyond what I thought any short could achieve.
13217,One of the best films I've seen in a long time..and one of the best actors I've seen in a long time..and one of the best actors I've seen in a long time..

13221,"Ghost Story (the TV Movie--1972) was the pilot for the NBC series. The movie was well-written and well-acted and, I thought, when the 1972-73 tv season started, then NBC has a winner."
13222,"Ghost Story,(The New House) is a terrific horror story. This is from the Circle Of Fear and the Ghost Story series of the early seventies.The beginning and ending of each story is narrated by Sebastian Cabot."
13223,"I grew up watching this series. I still remember the 1st episode which was called ""The New House."" It scared the h*ll out of me!"
13224,One of the best ghost stories I've ever seen..and I've seen many of them..now I've see many of them.
13225,"One of my all-time favorite films, and it's well worth seeing. A fine example of Peter Weir's ability to create tension out of nothing."
13226,The Last Wave shows the gulf between two cultures who live side by side but lack understanding of each others culture and traditions. Weir has opened our eyes to the mystery that lies beyond our consensual view of reality.
13227,"""The Last Wave"" is one of those movies that relies heavily on the mind. The title refers to the Aboriginal doomsday theory: there will be one last wave that wipes out everything."
13228,One of the most haunting and fascinating movies ever seen. Richard Chamberlain does his best performance here as the Australian lawyer who defends a group of young Aborigins accused of murder.
13229,THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth. Richard Chamberlain gives a good performance as a defense lawyer whose life becomes increasingly unmoored from reality as he delves deeper into a murder case involving Aboriginal
13230,The end of the world is coming to the Australian coast city of Sydney.........
13231,"'The Last Wave' is far more than the sum of its parts. It's not merely a disaster film, not simply an exploration into Australian Aboriginal spirituality, and certainly more than a simple court drama."
13232,One of the best films I've seen in a long time..and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time..and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time..
13233,"One of the best movies on the subject of magic and the occult in a very long time.brbrI watched it again after many years tonight. I would say if you have any intention to watch this movie, watch it on"
13234,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.........
13235,"""The Last Wave"" is a dramatic thriller with some shocking moments. Remember, ""hacking and slicing"" doesn't make a film a horror movie, it's the psychological element of fear and trepidation that rests within us all."
13236,"""Who are you? Who are you?................... "
13237,"The end of the world may be at hand, and the aborigines may know this but no one else does. Richard Chamberlain as the lawyer is at his peak here."
13238,One of the best movies I've seen since Picnic at Hanging Rock.........
13239,"Not as interesting as I'd have liked, but still worth a watch. I'd give it a 7 because it's got enough great ideas to overcome its boring moments. I'd give it a 7 because it's"
13240,One of the strangest movies I've ever seen. I can only say that this movie goes in directions that no one will be expecting. I can only say that this movie goes in directions that no one will be expecting.
13241,"And All Through The Houst is among Tales From The Crypt's best. Most notable for it's escalating suspense and narrative twists, And All Through The Houst is among Tales From The Crypt's best."
13242,"""And All Through the House"" is a special crypt episode not only because it's from the first season, but this episode was the first one I saw!"
13243,"Tales from the Crypt: And All Through the House is a decent one all the same, worth a watch but after the comic book story & original 1972 film version did we really need or even want this?"
13244,"This is one of the best episodes of The Twilight Zone. I have watched it more often than any other episode, it is that enjoyable. And it is quite scary, but all in good, ghoulish fun."
13245,The second installment is just as good as the first. I like how the first and second episodes have nothing in common except for the wit and cleverness.
13246,"One of the best episodes of the cable TV series ever made. Robert Zemeckis makes the most out of a witty script by Fred Dekker. Mary Ellen Trainor, who was married to Zemeckis when she starred in this episode."
13247,"It's not that scary. But it sure is fun. But it sure is. 9/10- 30 minutes of pure holiday terror. Okay, so it's not that scary. But it's not that scary. But it sure"
13248,"One of the last classics of the French New Wave. For direction, cineaste Jean Eustache drew from the simplicity of early-century cinema. For story, Eustache drew on the torments of his own complicated love life."
13249,One of the greatest films of all time - and it's not just because it's a French New Wave film. It's because it's so powerful.
13250,"A movie that is both related to the time it was released (post-68) and eternal in many respects. True, the actors don't ""act""... But what they talk about is just what makes life worth living... or dying"
13251,"I'm looking for a patron, anyone interested? I'm looking for a patron, anyone interested? I'm looking for a patron, anyone interested?"
13252,"Jean-Pierre Léaud's ""The Mother and the Whore"" is one of the most discussed movies of all times, but the dialogs appear almost ridiculous in this movie."
13253,"In order to love, you have to have some level of happiness, of real truth. Is it possible to have two lovers? Some can try, but what is the outcome if no one can really have what they really want..."
13254,"""La Maman et la putain"" and ""In search of lost time"" apparently tell the same story : the one of the failure of love"
13255,"this movie is so complex that it can be given any description and still roll with it. you have a insecure, troubled and fascinating main character (played by Jean-Pierre Léaud) who is trapped between two (no, three) women"
13256,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, but I don't know if I'll watch it again until I'm older."
13257,"A great movie, rather challenging than really entertaining. Sadly, no memorable quotes here, but this one's my favorite. Alexandre: If you're leaving someone that you have loved, you have to say what I'm telling you"
13258,One of the greatest movies I have ever seen. Jean Pierre Leaud is amazing (more than usual) and the movie is one of the most unforgettable of the vogue.
13259,"Not bad for a film that's only 210 minutes long, but it's not for the faint of heart. brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr"
13260,"Well, of course not. Women are overly sensitive and needy on average, which is interestingly portrayed from mother to whore, though not pseudo-artistically, extravagantly, or blatantly dwelt on"

13264,"What's the difference, and is there one, between Eustache's Léaud, and Truffaut's, and Godard's?"
13265,"One of the best filmgoing experiences I have ever had. It was one of the best filmgoing experiences I have ever had. I was in the theater for close to four hours, but it was worth it."
13266,"A decent show with a few over-the-top moments, but overall it seems like a decent show. Jeremy Sumpter does an excellent job as a teenager with a passion for baseball, I believe a lot of us could relate to his"
13267,it was so good we were glued for the whole thing.. hahaha.i think I'm hooked for the season!!.... they have some really good actors in this thing.. the head coach guy and the player that likes pete
13268,"Dowry in marriages is the major problem nowadays. In this movie, the Indian values are stated very well. Today's youth must understand this problem."
13269,"One of the best Sammo Hung films of all time, and one of the best of all time in the martial arts genre. The Fat Dragon is fatter in this outing than he was in ""Condors"", but he's no"
13270,Sammo Hung and Max Mok Siu Chung at their best in this classic kung fu film!<n>Sammo Hung and Max Mok Siu Chung at their best in this classic kung fu film!

13272,"This is a great film and the Light Sabre duel Star Wars tribute has to be seen to be believed!! There are moments of genius throughout this movie, if you can, SEE IT NOW!"
13273,One of the best Sammo Hung movies ever made. A must see for any fan of action. Billy Chow and Sammo Hung are amazing. A must see for any fan of action.
13274,"One of the best Hong Kong (action) films around and it has a tense and exciting storyline as well as great fight scenes. This Sammo film has it all, Romance, Drama, Excitement and a great hero as well."
13275,"One of the better kung fu movies, but not quite as flawless as I had hoped given the glowing reviews. The movie starts out well enough, with the jokes being visual enough that they translate the language barrier."
13276,"Sur mes levres is a psychological suspense yarn where sex, drugs and money infiltrate the lives of several characters. Unlike Hollywood productions, this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street"
13277,"A breath of fresh air to the stale, predictable, unimaginative, crash bang wallop drivel being churned out by Hollywood. What a good example for screenplay writers, actors, directors and cinematographers to follow."
13278,"""Sur mes lvres"" or ""Read my Lips"" is one of the best thrillers I've seen in a very long time."
13279,"One of the best film noirs I've seen in a long time - and it's from the French, not the U.S.<n>One of the best films I've seen in a long time"

13284,One of the best films I've seen in a long time                  
13285,"Interesting characters, lots of tension. As close to black and white without being black and white without being black and white. Too bad, the film could have been great"
13286,"One of the best French films of the 20th century, and one of the best French movies of all time, by Jean-Jacques's point of view."
13287,"Read My Lips is a pulpy, lonely- hearts thriller. It's perfect for the grizzled charisma of Vincent Cassel and features a marvellously contained performance from Emanuelle Devos."
13288,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long, long time!"
13289,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more than once, but it's still the best movie I've seen in a long time."
13290,"A very good, tight plot, an intriguing hook in the form of the ugly, fat, deaf girl and the ex-con, and a pace that kept things flowing without being hurried"
13291,'READ MY LIPS' is one of the best films I've seen in a long time - and it's not just because it's French.
13292,"Sur mes lvres or READ MY LIPS is fine little thriller that also examines the lives of 'outsiders', people who live in the periphery of our vision who struggle with the need to 'fit in'"
13293,"""Sur mes lvres"" (Sur mes lvres) is a nifty, contemporary tale of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a crime caper"
13294,"""Read My Lips"" is a genre-defying piece, switching from dark comedy to visceral full-throttle thriller. Jacques Audiard's third feature ""Read My Lips"" is a genre-defying piece, switching from dark social"
13295,"One of the best French films I've seen in a long time, but it's not quite as good as I'd like it to be"
13296,"Clever and surprising story in many ways, except that the female is there to support the male.brbrThe soundtrack, as seems to be increasingly the case with European films, is great and in perfect sync with the film's"
13297,You don't want to hear it. She can't and neither can you until your hearing aid is in place. Prepare to experience life from the perspective of the hearing impaired.
13298,One of the best films I've seen in a long time.........
13299,"One of the best French films of the decade so far. Emannuelle Devos gives a truly stunning performance, at times devious and manipulative. Another reason why those who appreciate quality cinema should keep their eyes open for offerings from France."
13300,"One of the best film noirs I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
13301,"Worth seeing, but perhaps not seeking out. Seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival on 4/28/2002. Seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival on 4/28/2002."
13302,Sur mes lvres is an entertaining French film with good characterization. It goes quite as easy as in Rear Window (an obvious reference and definitely not a noir film) but with a less compelling context.
13303,A very interesting film : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : :
13304,One of the best films I've seen in a long time. I'd give it 4 stars if I could. I'd give it 5.
13305,"This film has a rotting core of flexible morality, and yet a quirky sense of justice. So many of the regular Joes among us would love to ""stick it to the MAN"""
13306,"A coming out party for Pierce Brosnan the actor. This new guy is something else entirely!! Have read that Shepard thought Brosnan was too much the pretty boy for this plum role, but Brosnan proves to be the perfect Julian Noble,"
13307,"Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, and Hope Davis are the stars of this movie. It's a great, funny, and sexy comedy."
13308,Pierce Brosnan's best role yet. He's the best actor I've seen in a long time. He's the best actor I've seen in a long time.
13309,"""Margaritas and Cock..."" is one of Brosnan's best performances to date. He could shoot your mother and apologize immediately thereafter and you'd probably forgive him. I wouldn't be averse to seeing an Oscar nod"
13310,"Richard Shepard's ""The Matador"" is a great movie. Pierce Brosnan is great as a burned-out assassin. Don't miss it."
13311,THE MATADOR is hit-man movie lite....if you can say that about a hit-man movie. The violence is never really shown but often introduced. At first I was scared I was in for another retread of mid
13312,One of the funniest films I've seen in a long time.........
13313,A sleeper gem indie hit. A sleeper gem indie hit. A.K. Shepard makes a solid big screen debut with a pointedly wicked black comedy with a sharp eye for visual detail and nuanced dialogue and character development.
13314,"The Matador is a strange film, but it's a good one. It's not as bad as I thought it would be, and it's not as bad as I thought it would be."
13315,"The turning point in ""The Matador"" comes about half through the movie.<n>Pierce Brosnan, acting against type, makes a great contribution with his irreverent Julian Noble."
13316,"A film that respects its characters enough to just let them get on with it, without feeling the need to shove them into needless plot contrivances. And ultimately, it is about friendship, even in the most unlikely of places."
13317,"One of Brosnan's best roles.. but not as good as ""The Matador""<n>Great Brosnan in not equally great movie. Great Brosnan in not equally great movie."
13318,"The Matador is better upon reflection because at the time one is watching it, it seems so light. The humor is always medium-gauge, never unfunny but never gut-busting"
13319,One of the best films I've seen in a long time.........
13320,"Not to mention easily Pierce Brosnon's best performance. Of course Greg Kinnear is always great. Really, when has he really been bad? I think this film is incredibly underrated!"
13321,One of Brosnan's best performances since As Good As It Gets and Kinnear's best role since Jack Nicholson's gay neighbor in As Good As It Gets
13322,Brosnan is genius! Kinnear was as charismatic and as funny as anyone could have been in the role! What an unexpected pleasure! My favourite line would be 'I feel like a bangkok hooker on a Sunday after the navy left
13323,"Not what you'd expect from a Brosnan film, but it's a great one anyway........"
13324,Brosnan plays against type - and has lots of fun doing so. This is a film about a hired assassin who befriends a harried businessman... and it works!
13325,One of the best films I've seen in a long time. Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear bring it to life on the big screen. One of the best films I've seen in a long time.
13326,"""The Matador"" is a dark comedy starring Pierce Brosnan.<n>""The Matador"" earns points for the complexity of its characters and the quality of its acting."
13327,One of Brosnan's best roles. He's excellent in this role. Greg Kinnear is excellent as Brosnan's straight man. Hope Davis is quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep within
13328,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. Pierce Brosnan is great as the assassin. Greg Kinnair is great as the straight and narrow business man.
13329,Dark comedy? Gallows humor? How does one make a comedy out of murder? It can be risky business as the viewer is required to let go of their moral values and laugh at the antics of a man who kills people
13330,"I really enjoyed this movie but I got to say next to Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinear is pretty lackluster. It is kinda of an indie flick and was really nice to see especially with all of the mainstream movies that flood the movies at"
13331,"Brosnan's best Bond performance in a long time, and it's not just because he's a man of his own. It's because he's a man of his own."
13332,One of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good comedy with a well-written script and a big moustache.
13333,One of the better buddy comedies in a long time. Pierce Brosnan is outstanding in a very different role. He has dumped the slick armani suits for a ridiculous look and pays off showing that he is an excellent actor.
13334,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. Pierce Broson is amazing as a hit man. Greg Kinnear is awesome as a mild mannered man.

13336,"""Return of the Jedi"" is better than ""Empire Strikes Back"", but not as good as ""The Phantom Menace"" or ""The Empire Strikes Back"""
13337,"I'm sick of people whining about Ewoks! True, they're not the best thing that ever happened to Star Wars, but they DID happen, so deal with it!"
13338,"One of the best gifts I've ever received...a box full of action figures from the original set. It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, Anakin Skywalker, stopped being produced and"
13339,Star Wars: Return of the Jedi is a very good movie but the Ewok's are the worst thing to happen to the saga..         
13340,"One of the best Star Wars movies ever made, and one of the best in the entire series, by far. I've seen it more than once."
13341,"The last film in the saga is a lavish, spectacular production. It is a notch above episode IV (and just a notch below episodes III and V). In fact, I think it is the third best film in the 6-part saga."
13342,"One of the best ""Star Wars"" films of all time, but not as good as ""A New Hope"" or ""The Empire Strikes Back"""
13343,Star Wars: RETURN OF THE JEDI is one of the best movies in the series...but it's not as great as its predecessors.
13344,"""Return Of The Jedi"" is the greatest ""Star Wars"" film of all time. brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr"
13345,"Return of the Jedi is the most action packed of the series, and is a fine conclusion to the Star Wars Saga. The Rebel Alliance is facing an uphill struggle against the dark side, and only our favourite heroes can pull it off."
13346,I thought ROTJ was clearly the best out of the three Star Wars movies. I find it surprising that ROTJ is considered the weakest installment in the Trilogy by many who have voted.
13347,"Star Wars is more than a movie. it's an idea. it's an idea. it touches on the most universal stereotypes, good vs. evil. it does this so obviously, so profoundly, that literally any person from any"
13348,"It's still a very good film, even if a lot of its quality depends on the characters that have been built up in the superior 2 installments."
13349,I'm going to set you all on fire! I'm going to set you all on fire! I'm going to set you all on fire! I'm going to set you all on fire!
13350,Return of the Jedi is one of the best movies from the Star Wars series. It's one of the best battles of all time.''The Death Star 2''

13352,One of the best Star Wars movies ever made...........

13355,"One of the best episodes in the series, but too much ewoksssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss"
13356,"Return of the Jedi is my favorite of the Original Trilogy. It's got action, drama, romance, great battles, fantastic Acting, amazing fight scenes, and awesome music by John Williams."
13357,Star Wars: Episode 4 - The Best Star Wars Ever..........
13358,One of the best movies in the history of the Star Wars saga. It's not a 'good' movie - it's fantastic! It's not a 'good' movie - it's fantastic!
13359,The Return of the Jedi is better than the prequel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
13360,Star Wars: Return Off The Jedi Is A Good Movie But As You Might Have Seen On Video They M|might Have A Party At The End And They Just Probably End The Movie With...
13361,Darth Vader v.s Luke Skywalker on the Death Star is one of the best in the Star Wars series. The best duel of Star Wars between Darth Vader V.s Luke Skywalker on the Death Star.

13364,"An interesting story based on a true murder, but not as good as it could have been. Kathryn Morris does a great job as the victim, but it could have been better."
13365,This movie really touched me because it showed how sad and hard life can be. I really did cry in the end (which I don't want to give away!) It also let me realize how cruel and sickening people can be when it
13366,"One of the saddest yet complicated murder of all. You are missing out. The murderer is popular Delaware attorney, Tom Capano and the victim is the Delaware Governor's Scheduling Secretary, Anne Marie Fahey. Their relationship was a well-kept"
13367,"Thomas Capano was not Anne Marie's boss Tom Carper, the Governor was. That is the reason the Feds became involved, he called Clinton and asked him to get the Feds involved in the case"
13368,"True to the facts of the case...well, at least until you've seen the movie...well, at least until you've seen it!"
13369,"I was surprised how much I enjoyed this film. I thought it was funny, sexy, painful, and warm. Andie MacDowell's performance was nuanced and vulnerable. For once, the director of a MacDowell film"
13370,A hidden gem that should have done TONNES of box office. (now I have to look around to purchase a copy! (now I have to look around to purchase a copy!
13371,"A refreshing, enjoyable movie. If you enjoyed, ""Four Weddings and A Funeral"", ""Peter's Friends"", etc., you will see a number of familiar and talented actors."
13372,"A pleasant, poignant and enriching film. I loved all the characters, they were a little exaggerated in places. The way it looked and the enjoyably giddy ride the main character took until it turned badly, as real life can and does."
13373,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once.
13374,"The English establish very well when it concerns matters of the heart. Crush provides a combination of drama, humor and such irony that I find the English establish very well when it concerns matters of the heart."
13375,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time - but it's not quite as good as I'd like it to be.
13376,One of the best films I've seen in a long time. I laughed and cried at the same time. It was just really touching. Although not a new concept this was a very well made film.
13377,"A sweet reminder that love can be found just anywhere if your antennae are acutely active. I liked the quick sexual encounter, which must be out of character for a normally reserved school teacher (MacDowell)"
13378,"Love this movie! Although it is a little dirty, it reminds of a British or Irish version of Prime. If you liked this movie you should watch prime."
13379,"Well, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was funny and sad and yes, the guy Andie MacDowell shagged was hot. I think my Mum would like it."
13380,Beauty is all around in this movie! Andie again is doing superb job! It is a shame that this movie got such low marks! 10 out of ten!
13381,One of my favorite films of all time! SPOILER ALERT!! SPOILER ALERT!! SPOILER ALERT!! SPOILER ALERT!! SPOILER ALERT!! SPOILER ALERT!!
13382,"""Crush"" reveals the power of a sudden passion to overwhelm and surprise. At the same time, it reveals the power of a sudden passion to overwhelm and surprise."
13383,"I think the weighted average for this film is too low. I give it a 7. Very entertaining, although over the top in a few places. My wife says it passes the Danielle Steele test."
13384,"""Anjos do Sol"" exposes the sad and shameful reality of child prostitution in Brazil. Director Rudi Lagemann presents a great movie exposing the reality but never showing nudity or explicit sexual scenes."
13385,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time........."
13386,"Claustrophobia and muted colors convey the sense of limited space, drab architecture, overall drabness that constitutes the urban environment of most people in Eastern and Central Europe"
13387,"I think that the idea of the plot is perfect for exploring first of all the emotional experiences of the people involved and second, as someone else wrote in a comment"
13388,"""I want to stop...and if you love me, you will do as I ask you""...I want to stop...and if you love me, you will do as I ask you""."

13390,"not as good as i expected,but still worth seeing if you don't get annoyed by the plot and the acting.<n>The soundtrack was good and well adapted,but the acting was not convincing and the lines common,lacking"
13391,One of the most beautiful films I've seen in a long time... and I've seen it more than once.. I've seen it more than once..

13394,One of the best hip-hop films of the 80's. A must see for hip-hop lovers. A must see for hip-hop lovers.
13395,The best of all the hip-hop/breakdancing movies that came out around that period. Of course the 80's are considered a joke now with all the bad tv shows and movies
13396,One of the best shows I've ever seen. I'll miss it. I can't wait to see it in the movies next year.
13397,Stargate is the best show ever. All the actors are absolutely perfect for there roles. If you have not seen this show I very highly recommend it. I am a star trek fan but i would definitely rate this show well above any of the
13398,"One of the best Sci-Fi shows I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time."
13399,"""Stargate SG-1"" is one of the most well made, interesting, long running, exciting sci-fi ever produced. And why? Because it runs on an amazing premise."
13400,"""Stargate SG-1"" is the longest-running sci-fi series in the world and the second-longest running American sci-fi series in the world."
13401,"Stargate SG1 is one of the best Sci-Fi programs I've seen in a long time. The Movie was sub-par, but this Television Pilot delivers a great springboard into what has become a Sci-Fi fans Ideal program"
13402,"It's not about technology or space fighting - it's about helping your friend, even risking your life for him. It's about ""we don't leave anybody behind"""
13403,Claudia Black's 'Vela' has brought the series down in my estimation. To bring her in as a regular at the same time as including Ben Browder to replace RDA was a mistake.
13404,The new look of sci-fi created by Stargate SG-1 is a wonder that I hope will never end. Season #9 should be a thrill in itself.
13405,A worthy addition to the sci-fi genre...........
13406,"Stargate SG-1 follows and expands upon the Egyptian mythology presented in the original SG-1 series.<n>In the SG-1 universe, humans were enslaved and transported to habitable planets by the Goa'uld such as Ra and Apophis."
13407,"A great spin off of sorts from the 1994 movie ""Stargate""<n>The Gouald are parasites who can get inserted into one's brain, thus controlling them and doing evil deeds."
13408,"I'm starting to pick up traits from Carter, and all of this is driving my parents NUTZ!!!!!!! Well, to conclude, I think it's good for another three seasons or so, especially if they keep on packing the episodes"
13409,One of the best sci-fi shows i've ever seen. I've watched it over and over. I've watched it over and over. I've watched it over and over. I've watched it over and
13410,"Stargate SG-1 is a cheesy sci-fi TV series, but it deserves all the credit it gets for its quality and consistency.brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr"
13411,A must see for all sci-fi fans and people of genres because this has such a wide range of things to appeal to all ages and all types of people Watch IT!!!!!
13412,"One of the best sci-fi-series I've seen in a long time. brbrThe series has a nice blending of action, humor and drama. brbrJack O'Neil takes his team"
13413,"The best adaptation of Heinlein's Starship Troopers novel to date, though it's not as good as Verhoeven's film."
13414,"Verhoeven's movie was utter and complete garbage. He's a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed. By his own admission, he read 2 chapters of the book, got bored, and decided to make the whole"
13415,"Good, but not quite as good as Amityville, but still worth watching for its psychological depth......"
13416,"Another Aussie masterpiece, this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural, and it does very well. A relatively simple plot that Rebecca Gibney & Co. bring to life."
13417,Just two comments....SEVEN years apart? Hardly evidence of the film's relentless pulling-power! Just don't expect fireworks! $10.95 would be an acceptable price for the film
13418,"Somewhat funny and well-paced action thriller that has Jamie Foxx as a hapless, fast-talking hoodlum who is chosen by an overly demanding U.S. Treasury Agent (David Morse) to be released on the streets of New York to"
13419,"I liked the film. Some of the action scenes were very interesting, tense and well done. I especially liked the opening scene which had a semi truck in it."
13420,One of the most underrated movies of 2000 period..not a bad movie by a long shot. Its never boring. Its always funny and I wasn't checking my watch every minute. That should count for something.
13421,This is a really interesting movie. It is an action movie with comedy mixed in. Foxx teams up with comedian Epps in this movie to give it a comedic spin. It will keep you wondering whats going to happen to Foxx next.
13422,I agree with most of the other posts. Was it a comedy? a drama? to me it leaned a little to much towards the comedy side. I could have been a great movie without the comedy and it was horribly contrived.
13423,"This movie surprised me. Some things were ""clicheish"" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie ""Enemy of the State"" starring Will Smith. But for the most part very entertaining- good mix with Jamie Foxx and"

13425,"Good, but could have used a 'less funny' character as Alvin Sanders. Foxx's scenes for instance in the jail when he is confronted by Edgar Clenteen (David Morse) are too funny."
13426,"Not so bad, but not as good as I thought it would be........."
13427,"I thought it was highly entertaining; it was fun. To me, Foxx is an original. David Morse is terrific (true, this is not his finest role)"

13429,I really liked this movie. Of course the idea is pretty much out there...the federal government arranging to have a tracking device implanted into the jaw of an small-time thief to lure a more dangerous thief/computer hacker out of hiding.
13430,A great action movie with a great supporting cast...........

13434,"Good, but not as good as Enemy of the State' with Will Smith and Gene Hackman, but still a solid action film."
13435,"I'm surprised at the low rating for this. Maybe I just caught this move on the right night, or vice versa, but I'd give it a 7/10"
13436,"This is a good film, but it's not quite as good as I'd like it to be, but it's still a good one."

13438,"Drew Barrymore steals the show as the younger, impressionable brother-Barrymore shows signs here that he could have been an acting powerhouse. Moves at a nice pace to an exciting climax."
13439,"Not quite as predictable as a lot of good brother/bad brother Westerns do, but still worth a look. John Barrymore Jr. makes his debut."

13443,One of the best fairy tales I've seen in a long time for kids and adults alike.......
13444,The Great Yokai War is Miike's attempt at a family film and damn fine job he does as well. The problem is that I can't imagine many parents wanting to subject their children to this movie.
13445,One of the greatest children's films ever made. Not for younger or more sensitive kids though. See it for yourselves and if you think your kids can handle/appreciate it then show it to them.

13450,"One of Miike's best, but it's not a great adventure film. It's a lot of fun, but it's slow."
13451,"One of Miike's most accessible and engaging ventures yet, with enough visual drama and great performances to appeal to audiences of all ages, and more adult than either."
13452,"Miike proves that he can deliver the goods on a post-modern soup of mythical fantasy conventions.<n>An epic battle that is more like a ""festival"" than something out of Lord of the Rings"

13465,George C. Scott at his best in this version of A Christmas Carol.........
13466,One of the greatest actors of the 20th century. Far richer in texture and character than even the classics from the 30's and 50's.

13504,Vivah is one of Mr. Sooraj Barjatya's best films.. a must see for all lovers of kajol and shahid.
13505,"A good, clean, decent family movie with a couple of good songs. Alok Nath, Anupam Kher & Seema Biswas do a decent job."
13506,"One of the best movies to come from Bollywood in years. Certainly the best this year until now. The panoramic visuals, the heart-pleasing dialogs and the melodious and soft music make the movie an exceptional one."
13507,"One of the best Barjatya films I've seen in a long, long time......"
13508,"VIVAH is the best movie of 2006, coming from the director Sooraj R. Barjatya's successful career. The movie has top-notch performances, excellent story and great music to suit the film, as well as being directed"
13509,Suraj Barjatya back at what he is best at.A story woven around a marriage.It feels nice to have a movie in which there is no single scene which you would avoid watching with your family.
13510,"A very good looking film, very much like Yash raj's other films..<n>A very gentle film, very much like Bollywood classic.."
13511,One of the most touching real Indian movies I've ever seen. It was really refreshing to see a movie that showed traditional family cinema. As for the story I thought it was great it was about shahid kapur being set up
13512,This movie is a great attempt towards the revival of traditional Indian values which are being replaced by western ones.Its a joint family story showing all the ethics every person should follow while communicating with every single relative around.Shahid Kapoor gives a gr

13518,"Well... Vivah is quite a good, but typical Sooraj Barjatya's movie. It shows different aspects of Indian families, wedding ceremonies, etc."
13519,This is one of the best Bollywood movies i have seen up until now. Family and friends feel the same way about it. This movie is really romantic and dramatic at the same time.
13520,"The movie stands out for the classical touch given to the romance of the engaged couple. Thankfully this time all Indian locales like Ranikhet Almora etc have been used, which have been already visited by most of the urbanites"
13521,"One of the best romantic films I've ever seen -- and one of the best I've seen in a long, long time -- and one of the best I've ever seen!"
13522,"What can i say, i have grown up watching Hum Saath Saath Hain, Hum Aapke Hain Koun and Maine Pyaar Kiya. Soraj have always been different."
13523,A movie that defines your values and shows you the true depth of human emotions........
13524,'Soapdish' is one of the very best comedies of the 1990's. It's excellent script and A-Class cast make it a must-see. It's hard not to love this film after it's
13525,"An old-fashioned, delicious farce that plays like an issue of MAD Magazine. Robert Harling penned this riotous spoof that plays like an issue of MAD Magazine."
13526,"One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time."
13527,"One of those movies that holds a viewer's interest time and again. Lightweight movies seldom win Oscars, but whoever did the casting for Soapdish deserves one"
13528,"One of the best under-rated movies of all time, and one of the best comedy movies ever made......."
13529,Soapdish is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time........
13530,One of the funniest spoofs of the soap opera world I've ever seen........
13531,One of the Best Satires I've Seen In A Long Time... And I'm Not Just Saying That Because It's So Funny!
13532,"I don't watch soaps. But this movie takes parody and spells it a new way. I found the story pretty damn funny. The fashions of the 80's - shoulder pads, sequins, and polyester - just top it off."
13533,One of the funniest films I've ever seen..and I've seen it more than once..and I've seen it more than once..and I've seen it more than once..and I'
13534,"""Soapdish"" is the best movie I have ever seen. It's the best movie I've ever seen. I'm in love with Sally Field."
13535,This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time...and it's not just because of Teri Hatcher...it's because of Sally Field and Kevin Kline!
13536,"One of the best comedies I have seen in a long, long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long, long time!"
13537,"One of the funniest movies I have ever seen in my life. brbrIt's one of my favorite movies of all time, and it has to be the funniest movie I have ever seen in my life."
13538,"What more do you want? Sally Fields, Kevin Kline, Robert Downey, Jr., Cathy Mori, Whoopi Goldberg, The Hair Zing! (sorry)"
13539,"I'm not sure that this comment contains an actual spoiler, but I'm playing it safe, so don't read this if you haven't seen the movie"
13540,"One of my favorite movies of all time, a great cast of characters, and a great story line, all wrapped up in a fun fun movie for the whole family."
13541,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time - and it's not just because it's Shue's in it.
13542,"An over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top"
13543,Soapdish is the funniest movie I've seen in a long time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
13544,"This is a really fun movie. One of those you can sit and mindlessly watch as the plot gets more and more twisted; more and more funny. It's all these well-known, quality actors acting as if they are soap opera"
13545,"A wonderful Greek film, beautifully adapted and directed by Michael Cacoyannis, with an excellent music score by Mikis Theodorakis which is ideal in every scene.Rumours say that the film lost the best foreign language film Oscar by"
13546,"Iphigenia, the third film by Mikhali Cacoyannis, is an excellent adaptation of Euripides' tragedy.<n>Cacoyannis is faithful to Euripides in his representation of the other characters."
13547,"""Iphigenia"" with the incandescent Irene Pappas is breathtaking. Unfolding in a natural setting with Greek actors speaking their own language lends such authenticity."
13548,"One of Cacoyanis's best films, one of my all-time favorites, and one of the best I've seen in a long time."
13549,"A wonderful, wonderful story. Drama, sadness, some over the top acting but a wonderful time to be had. I watch this and it makes me sad for all the drivel the movie industry puts out and these beautiful little gems get passed"
13550,One of Michael Cacoyannis' best films. A must-see for fans of Greek and Greek-American cinema. Papamoschou steals the show.
13551,"This is the age of ""no animals were hurt in the production of this move."" Iphigenia was made in the late 70's before the advent of computer simulation. Was it possible to fake these animal deaths? Or were these animals"
13552,"A great little unknown horror movie. I'll give it 10 out of 10, but the ending made me angry, but I still give it 10 out of 10."
13553,"""Shallow Grave"" is a pleasant low-budget surprise.The cast is likable enough,the direction is steady and the violence is particularly nasty and misogynistic."
13554,"One of the best horror movies I've seen in a long, long time........"
13555,"One of the more enjoyable slashers of the 80's, not to be confused with the British black comedy of the same name that came out in 1994!"
13556,"""I'm getting up right now and walking out of your life forever because that's too self-indulgent to the point of engaging in jokes about glamour, celebrity, sex, loneliness, despair and shallow expressions of love and kinship"""
13557,"One of the funniest movies of all time, and Sandy gives a tour-de-force performance! Alas, her career never quite took off, but - at last - she will always be remembered for her three first-rate pictures"
13558,"If you ever have the chance to see Sandra live in person, you better move on it sweetie. I saw her last year in Los Angeles at the opening of her Everything Bad and Beautiful tour and i still can't believe that i was"
13559,"It's been nine years since I first saw this movie, and I still can't believe how long it's been since I've seen it."
13560,"One of those unfortunate films that suffered an even more sad, unfortunate death at the box office. I saw this film at a local art cinema,in revival form,shortly after it tanked in mainstream cinemas."
13561,"One of the most interesting movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time."
13562,"""Without You I'm Nothing"" is one of Bernhard's best efforts. It's an adaptation of her smash-hit off-Broadway show which made her a superstar  and Madonna's best friend for about four years"
13563,"A great example of a good, dumb movie. No, it is not high art by any means. Nor is the script anywhere close to a Woody Allen or Mel Brooks. BUT SO WHAT!"
13564,"This is not ""so bad that it is good,"" it is purely good! For those who don't understand why, you have the intellect of a four year old (in response to a certain comment...)"
13565,"If you liked Princess Bride and Forest Gump, You would like this movie. You can't compare the quality of the filming to those of course, but having the cameraman trip was obviously done on purpose. Killer Tomatoes is a hundred times better"
13566,"I've come to terms with Altman. Before, I always labeled his style of film-making ""boring."" You just have to be in the right mind to appreciate his crazy genius"
13567,"Not as ""masterpieces"" as some have suggested, but still funny and insightful. And the performances are funny, especially Cavett (as ""himself""), Lauren Bacall as an aging conservative figurehead, Glenda Jackson as a left"
13568,"Altman's ""H.E.A.L.T.H."" treats all of the humors, and actually in very funny, entertaining ways"
13569,One of Altman's last films with a large ensemble cast..........
13570,"One of the best comedies of the 1950's! Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, and Louise Beavers are all in the cast! Hilarious!"
13571,"One of the funniest films I've seen in a long time, and it's funny even if it's just for an hour or two."
13572,"One of the best comedies of all time, and one of the best movies of all time, in a very short period of time......."
13573,"""Mr. Blandings Builds his Own House"" is an extremely funny comedy, with witty lines and top-notch screenplay. Cary Grant is hilarious in the role of a man moved by the impulse of..."
13574,"If you're struggling with problems of homeownership, you'll enjoy this movie. It's funny, it's funny, it's funny, it's funny."
13575,"One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time - and it's not just because it's Grant, Loy, and Douglas."
13576,"The best film treatment of the difficulties of having a house built (or bought) to your specifications, but it is not the first, nor the last."
13577,"Political commentary is subtle in ""Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House""<n>Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas were all ""superstars"" in an easier, less complicated era"
13578,"""Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House"" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time...and it's a hoot!"
13579,"One of the best comedies I've seen in a long, long time. I've seen it many times, and still laugh out loud every time I watch it."
13580,"Great acting, great movie. If you are thinking of building see this movie first. The humor is true to life and emotions are those that anyone who has built has felt"
13581,"This is one of the few comedies I can watch again and again and still laugh out loud. I have read complaints about racism and sexism from sanctimonious, politically correct prigs."
13582,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once."
13583,"Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House is a wonderful film. It is not, I suppose, a masterpiece in the Capra-McCarey tradition, but it is a worthy successor to their pictures"
13584,"I loved this film. I first saw it when I was 20 ( which was only four years ago) and I enjoyed it so much, I brought my own copy the next day."
13585,Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House still works well as comedy because the situations are universal. And this review is dedicated to my Uncle Walter and Aunt Kate who lived in their dream house together for over 40 years.
13586,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time..and it's still true today..and still true today..and still true today..and still true today..and still true today.
13587,Cary Grant and Myrna Loy at their best in the 1940s! Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious!
13588,"One of the best comedies I've seen in a long time, and still relevant in today's society.A must see for anyone who has ever built or bought a house."
13589,"Cary Grant at his best in a very slow paced, but entertaining film. It's a great film for Cary Grant fans or for the whole family. It's a great film for Cary Grant fans or for the whole family."

13592,"One of Cary Grant's best performances in a long, long time........."
13593,"Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House may be the best Frank Capra/Preston Sturges movie neither man ever made! If you love Bringing Up Baby, The Philadelpia Story, The Thin Man, I Was"
13594,"One of the great classic comedies. Not a slapstick comedy, not a heavy drama. A buyers beware guide to a new home. A fun, satirical film"
13595,"""Mr. Blandings Buildings his Dream House"" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. I've watched it numerous times and it always makes me laugh."
13596,One of the funniest films I've seen in a long time.........
13597,"One of the funniest screwball comedies of the 1950's, but it's still relevant today. Hilarious......"
13598,"This is comedy as it once was and comparing this with the two remakes, THE MONEY PIT and ARE WE DONE YET?, only points out all the more how the 40's movie makers had a flair for comedy which has since,"
13599,"One of the best comedies of the 1950's, and one of the best noirs of the 1940's, with Cary Grant in the starring role."
13600,THE FREAK NATION LIVES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
13601,dark angel rocks! the best show i have seen in ages damn those people who took it off! me and my friends have gatherings to watch every DA episode! takes like 4 days but it is worth it!
13602,"It kicks ass and rocks as far as action goes, but the interactions of the characters and societal reactions to ""mutants"" remind us of the constant prejudices that we face (and make) everyday"
13603,DA can still make it big if it gets the right production work on it. i think James Cameron should take on this challenge. i was looking forward to new seasons.
13604,"Not as good as the first season, but still a good one.........."
13605,"Jessica Alba shines in this actionpacked and atmospheric serial. Wonderfully politically incorrect. Quality varies greatly from episode to episode, but generally the standard is high and when it is not."
13606,One of the best Sci-Fi shows I've ever seen - and I've watched it twice already. I'm 3 episodes away from having watched both seasons.
13607,"I think Dark Angel is great! First season was excellent, and had a good plot. With Max(Jessica Alba) as an escaped X-5, manticore creation, trying to adapt to a normal life, but still ""saving the"
13608,"The potential is there, but it doesn't quite click if you get my meaning. It's like most of the pieces are there, but a couple that make a complete image have been left out. Perhaps they get filled in with"
13609,"This show is so full of action, and everything needed to make a transgenic show.. but best of all... it actually has a plot (unlike some of those new reality shows...)."
13610,"Dark Angel is one of the best sci-fi series out there, but it was canceled after only 2 series. If you want more, ask Fox to make it."
13611,DA is one of my all time favorite TV shows!!!i can't understand why FOX canceled season 3!!!i like it so much!!!i even thinking about buying DVD on Amazon.(failed! :_(i am a Chinese
13612,One of the best shows I've seen in a long time. Jessica Alba does it again and again. She's the best actress I've seen in a long time.
13613,"This is the greatest show I've ever seen. It's definitely worth watching. Jessica Alba does such a great job in it. Michael Weatherly also does an awesome job, as well as the rest of the cast."
13614,the minis do the best acting job that i have ever seen kids do. the minis do the best acting job that i have ever seen kids do.
13615,Dark Angel is a cross between Huxley's Brave New World and Percy's Love in the Ruins--portraying the not too distant future as a disturbing mixture of chaos and order
13616,"I LOVE this show, it's sure to be a winner. Jessica Alba does a great job, it's about time we have a kick-ass girl who's not the cutesy type"
13617,the best sci-fi that I have seen in my 29 years of watching sci-fi. I also believe that Dark Angel will become a cult favorite.
13618,"I liked it, but it's not quite as good as I thought it would be. It's not quite as good as I thought it would be."
13619,Don't Say This Is Bad! Don't Say It! Don't Say It! Don't Say It! Don't Say It! Don't Say It! Don't Say It! Don't
13620,if you don't like it then there is something wrong with you. plus Jessica is just all kinds of hot!!!!! the only reason you may not like it is because it is set in the future where Seattle has gone to hell.
13621,"If you want mindless action, this is the show for you!brbrDark Angel is a great guilty pleasure filled with everything an action fan could ask for..."
13622,"One of the best films I've seen since 'Divorce, Iranian Style' in Iran........."
13623,"A remarkable documentary about the landmark achievements of the Women Lawyers Association (WLA) of Kumba, in southwest Cameroon, in legally safeguarding the rights of women and children from acts of domestic violence"
13624,"Powerful documentary about domestic abuse in the Cameroon. The ""sisters"" in law are female lawyers and judges who in 2004 successfully prosecuted husbands for abusive treatment of their spouses and won one woman a divorce she desperately wanted through a Muslim council."
13625,One of the most inspiring films I've seen in a long time--and I've seen it more than once--and I'm still waiting for it to be released in the U.S.
13626,Sisters in law will be released theatrically on March 24th in Sweden. A good occasion for our Nordic friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary. It was shown in Gteborg together with a retrospective dedicated to Kim Longinotto
13627,A fascinating look at Cameroon's legal system.<n>A fascinating insight into the life-style of Cameroonians....
13628,"Paul Lukas is the Best Actor Oscar winner of the 60's. I'm glad I did check this one out, because I enjoyed it immensely. I think the movie did preach a little, but not only did I not mind."
13629,"One of the best movies I've ever seen, and it's not preachy or boring. It just never gets old. Paul Lukas' performance brings tears to my eyes, and Bette Davis, in one of her very few truly"
13630,"""Watch on the Rhine"" was a play produced on Broadway eight months before the Pearl Harbor attack by the Japanese. In it Ms. Hellman was heralding America's entrance in World War II."
13631,"Lukas at his best in ""Watch On The Rhine"", and Bogart at his best in ""Casablanca""<n>The film has many good performances, led by Lukas as the exhausted but determined anti-Nazi fighter/courier, Davis as"
13632,I loved this movie so much I was reduced to tears. :-D. I loved this movie so much and recommend it to anyone!! :-D. I loved this movie so much and recommend it to anyone!!
13633,"""Watch on the Rhine"" was a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time it was released, as the evils of war and what was happening to people in other countries reach into safe American homes."
13634,One of the best anti-fascist films of the 1940's..........
13635,Outstanding film of 1943 with Paul Lukas giving an Oscar performance as the head of his family bringing them back to America from Europe as the Nazi menace deepened. Bette Davis maintains her reputation here and for a change was not nominated for best actress for this
13636,"Paul Lukas makes it clear that Naziism had to be stopped, and anything that helped do it was good. Lukas did give an excellent portrayal of a man caught in this situation, and made it clear that what he did was a very hard"
13637,I just don't 'get' Bette Davis. I guess I just don't 'get' Bette Davis. I've always thought of her as an actor that 'plays herself' no matter what role she's in
13638,"""A wrong-doer is often a man that has left something undone, not always he that has done something.""--Emperor Marcus Aurelius.<n>The DVD release of ""Watch on the Rhine"" could not come at"
13639,One of the best anti-nazi propaganda films made during World War Two. Paul Lukas was certainly deserving of his Oscar. Bette Davis shines brilliantly as the great actress and beauty she was.
13640,"This movie was nominated for best picture but lost out to Casablanca but Paul Lukas beat out Humphrey Bogart for best actor. I don't see why Lucile Watson was nominated for best supporting actor, i just don't think she did a"
13641,"An interesting curio, but a bit too preachy for today's viewing audience........"
13642,Watch on the Rhine reminds us of what we once aspired to be - a force for the betterment of humanity - and that we have it in us to once again aspire to lofty goals
13643,"A message movie, but a rather good one. Outstanding cast, top to bottom. Interesting in that Bette Davis's plot line is essentially back story!"
13644,"A different way of travelling the galaxy, and different kinds of adventures, this is one show you don't want to miss. You won't regret it!"
13645,"One of the best sci-fi shows of all time, and it's not just because it's better than BABYLON 5. It's because it's better than STAR TREK."
13646,"The Asgard has been killed-off in a very rushed, unconvincing and very unceremonious fashion! I think that the fans have been cheated with a poor clean-up of loose-ends!"
13647,"This is the best sci fi show to date, if you don't watch it, then you're missing out! I don't know what you're missing!"
13648,"Not as good as the first seven seasons, but still a great series. It's better than the spin off series, Stargate: Atlantis, but it's not as good as the first seven seasons."
13649,"One of the best Sci-Fi shows I've ever seen, but it's not as good as it used to be. It's not as good as it used to be."
13650,"One of the best sci-fi shows of the 90's, but it's getting better and better with each passing season. The 100th and 200th episodes are simply can't-miss."
13651,"One of the best Sci-Fi shows of the 90's, but it's time to move on to the next generation. brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr"
13652,An amusing and utterly sarcastic view of pop culture and the producers thereof. I was impressed with the photography that consisted of vivid colors and spin doctored settings.
13653,"One of the best indie films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time."
13654,One of the finest private eye films ever made. Biff Elliott is the definitive Mike Hammer. Harry Essex's script is excellent and contains many improvements on Mickey Spillane's novel.
13655,One of the best low budget detective films of the 50s..........
13656,"One of the better ""relationship"" stories out there. I think this is one of the better ""relationship"" stories out there. Maybe the younger generation won't ""get it"" but if you are over 40 I think you'll"
13657,Not as good as the book or that it differed from the book. I don't understand this type of criticism. Books and films are different media.
13658,"A simple movie in the beginning, a simple movie in the end. It does have that un-ending and pretending cliche, but, most tv movies have that any ways"
13659,Enjoyable movie although I think it had the potential to be even better if it had more depth to it. It is a mystery halfway through the film as to knowing why Elly is such a recluse.
13660,"""Just Cause"", while not a horrible film, takes too many liberties with the original material that Jeb Stuart didn't quite succeed in his treatment. Arne Glimcher directed."
13661,"""Just Cause"" is an above average thriller, but it's lacking in its story telling and style. It really is too bad. A fine cast and slick story with some unexpected twists and turns in it in which nothing is what it"
13662,"A Compelling Thriller!!, 10 December 2005 Author:littlehammer16787 from United StatesbrbrStarring:Sean Connery,Laurence Fishburne, and Blair Underwood"
13663,"Just Cause is a good thriller, but not as good as Cape Fear, Touch of Evil or Silence of the Lambs, but still a good one."
13664,JUST CAUSE is a flawed but decent film held together by strong performances and some creative (though exceedingly predictable) writing. Sean Connery is an anti-death penalty crusader brought in to save a seemingly innocent young black man from the ultimate penalty.
13665,One of the best mystery thrillers I've seen in a long time! I'm a big fan of Ed Harris and Scarlett Johannson's acting!
13666,"Just Cause is one of my favorite Sean Connery's movies.. it is a tense psychological thriller with excellent performances from the Cast, especially Connery..it also has one of the best lines i have seen in movies, so the dialog"
13667,The film shows vengeance is the worst possible motivation in the rendition of justice and in the establishment of public peace. And there can always be a mistake in that pursuit not of Happiness but of vengeance
13668,A good thriller/suspicion/suspicion/suspicion/suspicion/suspicion/suspicion/suspicion/suspicion/suspicion/suspicion/suspicion/
13669,"Connery, Fishburne, Underwood, Harris, Capshaw, Dee, Thigpen, and Thigpen all star in this very dramatic thriller."
13670,"I really liked this film. All three stars(Connery,Fishburne and Underwood) give credible performances;and Harris is enjoyably over the top"
13671,Connery and Fishburne work very well together in this thriller about murder and redemption. Keep your boots on for the strange turnaround at the end of the movie...you'd never expect it!
13672,I really enjoyed it. I like a good mystery. and this one had me guessing up to the end. Sean Connery did a good job. I would reccomend it to a friend.
13673,"Sean Connery does a great job. Lawrence Fishburn is good, but I have a hard time not seeing him as Ike Turner. As usual, Sean Connery does a great job."
13674,What is wrong with you people? This was an excellent film! I'm convinced that the people that didn't like this film weren't paying very good attention to the film
13675,One of the best movies I ve seen in a long time.........
13676,"This is an excellent movie. Pay no attention to the racist. If you can get over that there are characters who are played by blacks in this movie who outsmart the white characters, then you shouldn't have any problems enjoying this"
13677,"Ed Harris steals the screen away from anyone with whom he shares it, and that includes the formidable Sean Connery. The movie, which is more than a bit sanctimonious, comes alive only in the scenes when Harris is interrogated by the"
13678,British and American policy makers colluded in the deportation of the Chagos Islanders in the 60's and 70's.<n>The film shows that no provision was made for the islanders at the point of their ejection 
13679,"An astonishing story of a horrifically abused and largely unheard-of population is compelling, well-documented and enraging. As an American, I am constantly humiliated by my country's behaviour and this is just another in our long catalogue"
13680,"""Stealing a Nation"" is one of John Pilger's best documentaries. A must see for anyone interested in the history of the Chagos Islands."

13682,"I thought this was a splendid showcase for Mandy's bodacious bod. If you don't expect anything else, you won't be disappointed."
13683,"Eddie Murphy's first film since ""Beverly Hills Cop"", and it's a fun comic adventure. Lots of fun.brbr*** (out of four)"
13684,One of the best films I've seen in a long time! I loved it! I loved it! I loved it! I loved it! I loved it! I loved it! I loved it! I loved it!
13685,"One of Murphy's best, and one of his best in a long, long time......."
13686,"One of Eddie Murphy's best performances in a long, long time........."
13687,"""The Golden Child"" is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It's silly, it's funny, it's wonderful."
13688,Eddie is the only action hero I know who could begin a movie by making rude remarks behind some guy reading a porno magazine and end it with smart-aleck remarks about Ed McMahon.
13689,"I love this film. It is well written and acted and has good cinematography. The story blends action, humor, mysticism, and tenderness with great sets and beautiful location shots. See it, buy it, show it to your friends."
13690,"Eddie Murphy's ""Golden Child"" is a great vehicle for his humor, and a good movie for a serious topic.brbrThis is a fantasy/comedy that is based on the notion that there are both good and evil"
13691,"The Golden Child hits all the required genre buttons. Pretty girl, daring reluctant-hero with a quip in his armoury, dashing villain Charles Dance so English i could kiss him myself, wonderful colour, and a cute kid"
13692,"I think the movie was pretty good, will add it to my ""clasic collection"" after all this time. I believe I saw other posters who reminded some of the pickier people that it is still just a movie."
13693,Eddie Murphy at his best in this 80's action-comedy flick.brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
13694,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time."
13695,"The Golden Child is very funny, action packed and really quite compelling in a charming, almost magical way.brbr7/10 Great for all generations"
13696,"This movie was good for it's time. If you like Eddie Murpy this is a must have to add to your collection. Charlotte Lewis, Eddie's costar is hot. This was one of her first movies and she was"
13697,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time! I've seen it many times,and i still love it! I've seen it many times!"
13698,"A strange role for Eddie Murphy to take at the height of his career. While there is a lot of the ""Eddie Murphy character"" he plays a truly decent person."
13699,"Very funny film. Classic film funny Eddie Murphy of the 80s. I saw when I was a child and I have a good memory. The classic irony of Murphy does not fail, the film is funny, well done."
13700,"I liked Eddie in this movie better than any movie he has ever done. He wasn't The smart, cocky, know it all he usually plays. He shows heart and a more humble humor."
13701,almost Adam Sandler's worst film brbr br br br br br br br br br br br br
13702,"Not the worst of the Sandler films, but not the worst of the Sandler films! A good film, not the worst of the Sandler films, but not the worst of the Sandler films!"
13703,"A great companion piece to the ""Eight Men Out"" version of the life of Babe Ruth. The TV-movie rightly notes how Ruth never fulfilled his dream of managing the Yankees because of his flaws, while the Goodman version tries to push the"
13704,"A good movie, with a real-life feel to it, and a good story line.brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr"

13706,"Is there anyone out there who knows where to get a copy of this, so i can stop driving myself crazy? (also, it doesn't matter if its in in VHS format, i'm still in the ice age myself"
13707,This Schiffer guy is a real genius! The movie is of excellent quality and both entertaining and educating.brbrI didn't know what a weather girl was before I learned it here.
13708,The French Doors is one of the scariest films i've ever seen..and i've seen it more than once..and i've seen it more than once..

13711,Care Bears & Cousins - Origins of the Care Bears & their Cousins. Origins of the Care Bears & their Cousins. Origins of the Care Bears & their Cousins.
13712,"Care Bears 2 is a great movie for kids and adults of all ages. It's a great sequel to the first Care Bears movie, and it's even better than the first."
13713,"A strange cartoon, but a good message for children. A very positive message for children, though some elements of the film were strange, it was and still is a rather enjoyable film."
13714,"I was worried that my daughter might get the wrong idea. I think the ""Dark-Heart"" character is a little on the rough side and I don't like the way he shape-shifts into a ""mean"" frog,"
13715,"This movie is better than the first one, but it's not weird/strange. I think it is a wonderful movie. It is about how the Care Bears came about and to defeat the Demon, Dark Heart."
13716,"My favorite of the care bears movies. Once again I liked all the songs. Once again I liked the we care part at the end, although I know other people had mixed feelings about that scene. And of course I LOVED the songs."
13717,The Best Care Bears Movie I've Ever Seen!brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr

13721,"My children love it now! Granted, I can watch it now and realize the animation wasn't that great, and that the plot is trite. Hey, if every villian introduced themselves by saying ""I am DAAAARRRKK HE"
13722,"Good morals, but not as good as the first movie. I don't think I've ever seen a movie with such good morals, but I'm glad I did."
13723,"This was the movie that made me want to be a kid for the day.brbr I still have the tape, I haven't watched it in 5 years, but maybe I'll get around to it this week,"
13724,"Still love it 17 or so years after the first time I saw it, in fact I discovered that I had lost my copy of this and was very upset."
13725,"Great movie, great music, great story line, great story line, great movie! I loved it! I'll watch it over and over again!"
13726,"It's kinda fun to see the 1996-style Toronto I remember with all its silly haircuts, sunglasses, clothes, and attitude. It really hasn't changed any; just a nice, safe, cheap, provincial little urban backwater"
13727,"One of the greatest documentaries to ever come out of Canada. Al Pacino, Roger Ebert, Neil Simon, Matt Dillon as well as a constant slew of celebs make this film a Canadian classic."
13728,"Pitch is a must-see for students in film school to taste the mind and ego-bashing gantlet that is, for most, the road that must be traveled to sell oneself and one's projects in Hollywood"
13729,"A great look at Kenny and Spencer's attempt to pitch ""The Dawn""<n>A great look at how outsiders try to get to the inside to make it big"
13730,"Robert Taylor's ""The Last Hunt"" is one of the best Westerns of the 20th century... brbr""The Last Hunt"" captures the distant view of Buffalos grazing upon the prairie as the slaughter of these"
13731,"One of the best westerns I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it's a'morality story'"
13732,"One of Taylor's best performances. He is one of the best actors of the era. He has a maturity now that gives him the edge in this gritty, violent role."
13733,"One of the best westerns of the 20th century, if not the 20th century. BROOKS is one of the best directors of all time."
13734,"What a little gem. What a little gem. What a little gem. This film made in 1956 looks, and feels, like a late Seventies movie. And is in fact better, more restrained and correct than, say, Blue Soldier."
13735,A great western/social comment from the 50's. This should be in the same class as High Noon for real western drama or used as a social statement like Blackboard Jungle or Rebel Without A Cause was for 50's youth.
13736,One of the best films I have seen in a long time. Robert Taylor is the best actor in the role. Lloyd Nolan's character is annoying.
13737,The end of a tragic era of senseless slaughter and remorse for both the buffalo and the Native Americans. Taylor is blinded by his hatred of Indians and his naivete that the buffalo herds will never disappear.
13738,"""The Last Hunt"" is one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life and I've seen it many times since I was 13"
13739,"One of the best of the adult Westerns of the 50s, and years ahead of its time in its attitude to the environment. For anyone else this is one of the best of the adult Westerns of the 50s"
13740,Robert Taylor as the mad buffalo hunter Charlie Gilson is the main character in this film. At the beginning I was thinking that Charlie would end up redeeming himself like John Wayne in The Searchers or James Stewart in The Naked Spur
13741,"Disappointingly, it's still M.I.A. on DVD  even from Warners' recently-announced ""Western Classics Collection"" Box Set (which does include 3 other Robert Taylor genre efforts)"
13742,"One of the few westerns ever made to deal with Buffalo hunting, both as a sport and business and as a method of winning the plains Indian wars."
13743,"One of the best westerns I've seen in a long time, and I'm still haunted by the final scene            "
13744,The Last Hunt is the forgotten Hollywood classic western. The theme of genocide via buffalo slaughter is present in other films but never so savagely. Robert Taylor's against-type role as the possessed buffalo and Indian killer is his finest performance.
13745,"One of the few ""psychological Westerns"" that is truly in that genre. Stewart Granger loses his British safari hunter stereotype to play a haggard retired buffalo hunter who is revered in the West as one of the best."
13746,"""All the brothers were valiant"" turned into ""All the bison were valiant""<n>The real hero in the story are the bison and the northwest. The film is perfectly made, with the atmosphere of the times wonderfully given."
13747,"""The Last Hunt"" is an interesting and entertaining film, but falling short of what would be needed to consider it a ""classic""<n>The message surrounding the buffalo slaughter adds an extra dimension to the film and its conclusion is far superior to"
13748,"A nostalgic look back at a disappearing way of life, one where people still felt some sense of responsibility for each other, set in the lush green Victorian (the Australian state, not the era) countryside."
13749,I hope she can keep acting and directing. She's surely up to the task and could easily develop that visionary streak into a long career of unconventional and rare works of art
13750,"A heartwarming story about coping with grief and cherishing the memory of those we've loved and lost. Although, only 15 minutes long, Griffiths manages to capture so much emotion and truth onto film in the short space of time."
13751,"""Tulip"" is on the ""Australian All Shorts"" video from ""Tribe First Rites"" showcasing the talents of first time directors. I wish more scripts had such excellent dialogue."
13752,"A beautifully wrought, touching and heart-warming story of a man's journey in coming to terms with the loss of his wife through the relationship he shares with a very special animal, 'Tulip'"
13753,WWE's 2nd best PPV of 2002! A good surprise! John Cena had an excellent match against Chris Jericho. Jeff Hardy retained his IC title in a short sloppy match with Willam Regal. Bubba & Spike Dudley won a fairly violent
13754,One of the best PPV's i've ever seen. The DVD extras are worth the extra money for the extra content. This is the best PPV i've ever seen.
13755,"The Rock won the title that is so gay. Next I feel Regal should have got back his European title, Jeff Hardy is a crappy champ. Rob Van Dam had the Intercontinental title too long already Brock should have won it."
13756,Bubba Ray and Spike Dudley beat Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit in a Tag Team Table Match to win the title!<n>Chris Jericho beat John Cena to retain the Cruiserweight Championship!
13757,"This is still a great spoof of the Living Dead series, but it is also a satire of how people treat the homeless. What more could you want?"
13758,"""Night of the Living Homeless"" was a fairly strong finish to the first half of Season 11. Obviously a parody of various zombie movies, this episode parallels the homeless with the living dead, as creatures who feed and thrive off of spare change"
13759,"South Park at it's best when it's being ridiculous, and this week was no exception. It's a spoof of the zombie genre."
13760,One of the best spoofs I've seen in a long time! I'm sure George Romero's opinion was on this one! I'm sure it was purely positive!
13761,"Night Of The Living Homeless is a funny spoof of ""Dawn Of The Dead"".Only this time...with the homeless.The episode has homeless people all coming to South Park and the people cannot figure out why.They treat the homeless like zombies"
13762,"Stylish, moody, innovative revenge-driven bloodbath. It reminded me a lot of The Big Heat because it has the revenge plot set off by the exact same event, and the girl comes around to the good guy's side because of"
13763,"""Arzenta"" is an unpretentious,yet very likable film. It comes from Delon's rather short flirting with the Italian B cinema of the '70s."
13764,"""Big Guns"" is rather predictable, but it still qualifies as solid entertainment with lots of savage and often sudden killings. Alain Delon of ""The Godson"" is appropriately laconic as he methodically deals out death to the heads of the"
13765,One of Delon's best performances in a long time..........
13766,"One of Roger Corman's better, but small-scale, ""suspense"" films...and one of his better, but smaller-scale, ""suspense"" films."
13767,"Not your ordinary psycho movie. Lots of interesting and original slants on the genre. Sort of a ""Fatal Attraction"" for the younger set with some great blues music mixed in as the object of Amanda's affection is married to an"
13768,"One of the better ""obsessed killer"" movies I've seen in a long time -- and it's not just because it's on a budget"
13769,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, but I didn't know Jason Priestley had a sister. I'll leave it at that."
13770,"Good movie, but not as good as it could have been.........."
13771,"It's funny. It's not Arthur Miller or T.S. Elliot, but man this is funny. Kline and Fields are great. (Her toss-off line ""God, you are so disGUSting"" as"
13772,"One of the funniest movies I've ever seen, and it's not just because it's nominated for Best Picture. It's simply a winner."
13773,"A riotous farce set in the world of glamorous daytime soap operas! This film is hilarious! If you want to see a bunch of pros doing what they do best, get your hands on this one!"
13774,"This is one of the best comedy ever! The writing of this parody of soap is brilliant and the cast, well just look at the names of the cast and you'll understand why it is so great"
13775,One of the best movies I've ever seen - and I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more times than I can count.
13776,"It's the best soap opera I've ever seen in my life, and I've seen it more than once. It's the best film I've ever seen."

13783,One of the best horror films of the past decade. Kevin Bacon proves again that he can handle any role that comes his way. The action is intense and the chills are true. You may actually find yourself jumping if you are watching it in
13784,"Still fun in a ""dirty old man type of way,"" Hollow Man. The first two acts are so good that the slasher final act disappoints. Yet I am giving a recommendation to this film for it's MIND BLOWING special"

13787,This is TOS' first attempt at lightweight sci-fi - and it's a great one......
13788,"One of the best episodes to see on a purely non-aesthetic level. So, on a purely non-aesthetic level, it's great stuff."
13789,"One of the lighter episodes from the first season of Star Trek, but still fun to look back on as an adult. I'd say it's one of the lighter ones."
13790,"Good, but not the best representation of the show's story line. I'm glad to see that a TV show of this type had enough good sense to take a break from serious intergalactic conflicts."
13791,"One of the prime examples of following a suspenseful, dramatic episode with a lighter affair                "

13794,"'Shore Leave' holds up as another first-rate episode of Star Trek's first season. Despite the 'it was all a dream' sort of ending, 'Shore Leave' holds up as another first-rate episode of Star Trek"
13795,"Bizarre, trippy, forget-about-a-story-and-full-steam-ahead low budget sci-fi about the Williams family, living in the California desert."
13796,"Better than many 2001/CLOSE ENCOUNTERS knock-offs, but not as good as 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY or 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY"
13797,"If you love cult 70's Sci-fi the way I do, or if you like movies such as ""Repo Man"" or ""Buck you're going to love this one"" than you're going to love this one"

13823,"Parker Posey at her best as Mary, a young woman growing up in New York City......."
13824,"A great 90's flick! Parker Posey is fabulous in this story about the nightlife in Manhattan that requires so much cash. This is a good, light movie for Saturday night before you go out."

13830,Mellisa's rants are the funniest thing I've ever seen on reality TV! I can't believe she's still on the show!
13831,The Apprentice is one of the best reality shows of all time..but it's best watched in moderation..if you keep watching it for a while it will wear off fast.
13832,"""The Apprentice"" demonstrates that the traditional job interview and resume do not necessarily predict skills, task dedication, and job performance. And they certainly don't reveal any hidden agendas."

13852,"Salman, Preity and Raj are the main ingredients in this CCCC. But the main point of the story is something rare and unique in itself. Perhaps, many are happening in this large world where these are kept secret. But still then"
13853,A very good movie.The story is nice.It tells us about Raj who is in love with Priya.They get married.She later becomes pregnant.But shortly their is a problem.Sadly they wont get the child.Raj later meets
13854,I love this movie very much i watched it over and over. I don't see why anyone would think this movie wasn't good. Maybe you have seen better or whatever it is i personally love it.
13855,"""Como Era Gostoso o Meu Francs"" is another great low budget movie of the great Brazilian director Pereira dos Santos. The actors and actresses perform naked and Ana Maria Magalhes is magnificent."
13856,"I was hardly aware of the time in history depicted in this 1971 Brazilian black comedy, however that is not to say it wasn't accessible to me because the movie makes it very clear"
13857,One of the best films I've seen in a long time--and one of the best I've seen in a long time--and one of the best I've ever seen.
13858,A beautiful film about the life of Brazilian natives in the 16th century. A must-see for anyone who grew up in Brazil or knows about the area.

13860,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time--and one of the best I've seen in a long, long time."
13861,"One of my all-time favorites - but be warned, it is weird, like Werner Herzog weird - its weirdness stems from its super-realism."
13862,"The web of lies, truths and half-truths she turns through the film is brilliant. The film uses much interview footage, as well as dramatisations to tell it's story."
13863,"One of the most exciting feature films at the SF International Film Festival. Brilliant. I don't know if - other than Andrew Jarecki's ""Capturing the Friedmans"" - there has ever been anything like Anna Broinowski'"

13865,"What a fascinating film. Even if it wasn't based on real life, Forbidden Lies was a fascinating portrait of a con artist in her element. And it is the kind of film psychology students could study to learn about compulsive liars."
13866,"Forbidden Lie$(2007) is simply a better (cinematic) version of Norma Khouri's book Forbidden Love, and THAT was a best-seller"

13869,One of the few Japanese comedy characters that I find truly funny. The style is very sixties Barbarellish with a fantastic soundtrack by Yello. I cannot think of another Anime or general movie that has been able to do this so seamlessly and

13873,"solid police work and a good depiction of the faulty mind of a psychotic loser. Not a film of high voltage excitement, but solid police work and a good depiction of the faulty mind of a psychotic loser."
13874,"More TV movies should be made like this one. Helen Hunt and Steven Weber were both terrific, giving very gritty and realistic performances. Weber was especially good, turning in an exceptionally creepy and understated performance as the child molester/killer."
13875,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time. I've seen it a few times, but never as good as this one."
13876,This is one of the best movies out there and that's saying a lot being that it was for television. I really wish it was on d.v.d.

13887,"This is the best music DVD i have ever seen.The performance of Cream at their age was just mind blowing and sound quality is the best i have heard on a music DVD.It does not matter what type of music you like,this"

13891,It's a very difficult film to watch. But ultimately it is a very beautiful and deeply moving film. Any person who finds it cynical must have greatly missed the point of the film's entire message.

13910,"What network was, Diagnosis Murder on? I thought it was CBS. Am I right or?? Also, Back in those days, the actual production H.Q. was near about the Van Nuys Airport."

13914,Diagnosis Murder is one of the best programs i have ever seen on TV! When will they release all 8 seasons on DVD (not NTSC) so that i can watch it in order!
13915,"Good, clean fun, good humour and nostalgia for the days of the Dick van Dyke show. How innocent we all were (and how innocent is Diagnosis Murder)"
13916,"A feast of intelligent thoughtful acting, and a moving central performance from the beautiful and incredibly young Jean Seberg. Preminger doesn't jump around and show off- his long slow takes encourage you to listen and reflect, and Graham Greene'"
13917,One of Preminger's best and most effective films. Richard Widmark as the Dauphin is a real revelation. A comic performance that feels like an imitation of Jerry Lewis far more than this film comes to comic relief.
13918,"One of John Gielgud's best performances, but a little 'pick' here and there..a.k.a., a.k.a. a.k.a. a.k.a."
13919,"Jean Seberg is misdirected to be too sweet and too gentle. She fully shows enough acting talent, skill, and craft to convincingly play the clever, passionate, and confident Joan"
13920,"A solid adaptation of a great play by GBS, with great performances from Shauvians and newcomers to Jean Seberg and Richard Widmark's career."
13921,"The House That Dripped Blood is one of the best horror films I've seen in a long time. Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing and Ingrid Pitt are the stars."
13922,The House That Dripped Blood is one of the best horror movies of the Seventies. A must-see for anyone who loves the horror movies of the Seventies.
13923,A very good little horror anthology with some nice atmospheric touches. A very good and unusual movie score too. Try to see it on DVD--the Lions Gate one looks fantastic with strong colors and great sound.
13924,"""The House That Dripped Blood"" is actually worth seeing (well duh; it stars Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee). Aside from just being neat, there might be some undertones. It might be calling into question the issue of real horror"
13925,"The third in a series of seven Amicus horror anthologies. If THE MONSTER CLUB is included as part of the series, this would make eight movies. I look upon the Amicus anthologies with great memories as I used to love them when I was in"

13928,"""Sweets For The Sweet"" and ""Method For Murder"" distinguish themselves as highly effective journeys into fear. ""Method Of Murder"" is striking for its simplicity and stark terror. Dominic may or may not be real, so director Peter Duff"
13929,"One of the best British horror films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a very long time."
13930,"An interesting set of stories, but could have used a bit more back story for one of the main characters. I think they needed a bit more back story for that one."
13931,"One of the best of the Amicus series, but it's not the best of the whole series! I'd say it's the best of the bunch!"
13932,"""Method for Murder"" builds to a real dilly surprise ending. Highly recommended to fans of omnibus fright fare. Highly recommended to fans of omnibus fright fare."

13936,"""The House That Dripped Blood"" is an excellent Horror-omnibus that no lover of British Horror could possibly afford to miss. Highly Recommended!"
13937,A good example of a time when horror films were made with style and class. Watch this one with the lights off. I can't tell you how many times I rented this film during my childhood...
13938,One of the better anthology films of the time period...........
13939,One of my favorite type of horror movies of the Sixties till the mid-Seventies. This was a kind of movie very popular in the Sixties till the mid-Seventies and it's one of my favorite type of horror movies.
13940,The House that Dripped Blood is one of the best Amicus productions I've seen so far (even though I still have quite a few to check out)
13941,"One of the scariest movies I ever saw as a kid. (I had to walk MILES just to see a movie, and it was usually dark when I emerged from the..."
13942,An excellent movie and great example of how scary a movie can be without really showing the viewer anything. It's a set of four stories all revolving around the tenants of a charmingly old-fashioned house and their various gruesome and horrific fate
13943,One of the best old horror movies I've ever seen..........
13944,"One of the best of Amicus's films, and one of the best of the Hammers. A treat for fans of the Hammers, too."
13945,"One of the best horror movies I've seen in a long, long, long time, and it's not just because it stars Jon Pertwee!"
13946,Good fun for horror fans and has an excellent cast. The movie should also be required viewing for Doctor Who fans since Jon Pertwee (the third Doctor) has an amusing role as a rude and obnoxious horror star!
13947,"Enjoyed catching this film on very late late late late TV and it kept my interest through out the entire picture. This wonderful creepy, yet mysterious looking English home, with evil looking decorations and weired furniture and rooms that make you wonder"
13948,"This is an awesome Amicus horror anthology, with 3 great stories, and fantastic performances!. Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are simply amazing in this!. It's very underrated and my favorite story has to be the 3rd one ""Sweet"
13949,"A classy, intelligent 'four-hander' with a strong cast, despite a low budget which results in a few 'un-special effects'. The most outstanding contribution, however, is that of the 7-year-old Chloe Franks"
13950,"It's not just about entertainment. There's tonnes of subtle messages that i think Yasmin was trying to bring across. And yes, it might be confusing to some of you..."
13951,"A beautiful movie about a first love story. Everyone probably has one, and this is writer-director Yasmin Ahmad's story of hers, with a boy called Mukhsin."
13952,"A bit of a romance one may think of it, but once you've stopped yourself from reading too much critics and go for it, you'll notice the typical elements of Malaysia"
13953,"One of Yasmin Ahmad's better films, but it's not as deep as you'd think....."
13954,"I think it's better than Sepet and much better than Gubra in term of its story, its sentimental value.brbrThere are a few scenes that makes me touched. Yes I agree that the boy (Mukh"

13958,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.........
13959,"""CASOMAI"" was the last movie I've seen before getting married, just last year. brbrIt was also the first movie I've searched for, after I was married, because we promised to offer"
13960,"The moral of this story is that in order for a marriage to work out, both now, and in the past, it has been necessary for that relationship to be abutted by family and friends."
13961,The best film about marriage and family. This is a very interesting reflections to the couples that will be come to the dangerous and fascinating world of marriage and family.

13969,Not as salacious as it sounds. This is a three-part documentary (each episode is 50 minutes) featuring Slovenian superstar philosopher/psychoanalyst Slavoj Zizek
13970,"""The Perverts Guide To Cinema"" is not a documentary, it's a movie, and it's worth watching. It's not about ""the ultimate pervert art, it's about finding the cinema in reality."
13971,"Lots and lots of information to digest, and if you've seen Zizek, you know his pace.brbrAlso if you haven't seen most of the films or at least some other films by the same directors mentioned"

13974,"It's a good documentary, but it's too over-the-top and it's not for the faint of heart......"
13975,"This movie is a must for all those interested in cultural, literary, or psycho-criticism. It connects these theories with popular film, making them much more palpable and enjoyable than simply reading or thinking about them."
13976,"""You don't look for your desires in movies, instead cinema tells you what you should desire"" and concludes with the cineaste view that ""cinema is needed today so that we can understand our current reality"""

13978,"If you want Freud, be aware that you're getting Zizek's version of Lacan, which should not be confused with Lacan himself."
13979,"More like psychological analysis of movies, but Psycho does sound better as a header. The man in charge of the movie (the narrator if you will) does depict movies here in his own way"
13980,"Mardi Gras: Made in China provides a wonderful, intricate connection between popular culture, nudity, and globalization through the making and tossing of beads."
13981,"""Made in China"" is not the same as ""Made in the U.S."" or ""Made in China"" is not the same as ""Made in China"" or ""Made in the U.S."""

13983,"Excellent film that reveals how people are connected to the taken for granted, ordinary beads exchanged during Mardi Gras. It's a beautiful story without sentimentality or guilt associated with it, and the conclusion provides hope without leaving people feeling alienated."
13984,Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! I have never seen a non-preachy documentary on globalization until I saw MARDI GRAS: MADE IN CHINA
13985,"Sharp, well-made documentary focusing on Mardi Gras beads. I have always liked this approach to film-making - communicate ideas about a larger, more complex phenomenon by breaking the issue down into something familiar and close to home."
13986,One of the best documentaries I've ever seen - and I've seen it twice too. brbrI wish everyone could see it. brbrI wish this world was a better place.
13987,A great documentary about the sweat shop industry in China and how it affects the lives of so many people around the world. A must see for anyone who wants to learn more about the sweat shop industry.
13988,"Mardi Gras: Made in china is an excellent movie that depicts how two cultures have much in common but, are not even aware of the influence each society has on one another."
13989,"I wanted to like this movie, but it's too bad I didn't get to see it, and it's too bad I didn't get to watch it."
13990,The best political thriller I've seen in a long time. Al Pacino is brilliant as always. A must see for any political junkie. A must see for Al Pacino fan.
13991,One of the best political dramas I've seen in a long time. brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
13992,One of the best gangster movies I've seen in a long time.........
13993,"Excellent political thriller, played much quieter and slower than other, higher ranking films in this genre. When people talk about Pacino and Cusack how do they manage to skip over these amazing career topping performances?"
13994,"One of the best crime-drama movies during the late 1990s. It was filled with a great cast, a powerful storyline, and many of the players involved gave great performances."
13995,"One of the Best Political Dramas of the 90's. Al Pacino, John Cusack, &amp; Bridget Fonda are the stars of this one."
13996,One of the best films I've seen in a long time! I've seen it 3 times in a row! I watched it 3 times in a row!

13999,"A bit over-plotted ""City Hall"" does show how big city corruption can filter up, as well as down, to everyone in city government without them, like Mayor Pappas!"
14000,"A classic theme, but in real data and details. We are speaking of considering as less important to take a bad decision about some petty or supposedly petty criminal than some infrastructure or economic project in the city."
14001,One of the best political dramas I've seen in a long time...but it's not as good as I'd like it to be.
14002,"Al Pacino at his best as NYC's Mayor, John Pappas in City Hall.brbrA savvy thriller thats the first film ever shot inside the lower Manhattan structure that's ground zero for the City's government"
14003,"I liked the first part, but the second went off the rails. I wish Bridget Fonda had more scenes in the movie. The film went off the rails for me when the assistant mayor starting snooping around the mafioso to get to the"
14004,"City Hall is a good movie, but there's a problem with the pacing, and the script. It's not as good as it could have been."
14005,One of Pacino's best performances..he's great..he's great..he's great..he's great..he's great..he's great.
14006,"""City Hall"" is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it stars Al Pacino. It's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
14007,"Al Pacino, John Cusack, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello, and Frank Anselmo all shine in this great film about the Mayor of New York City!"
14008,"Not as good as, say, QUIZ SHOW, CITY HALL is of a similar cloth: engaging the mind as well as eye, ear, and heart. Why such well-hewn entertainment flops at the box office is anybody's guess"
14009,Great performances added to this tremendous film. Mr. Pacino once again gives us another brilliant character to enjoy. Kept my attention from start to finish. Great performances added to this tremendous film.
14010,"Brilliant execution in displaying once and for all, this time in the venue of politics, of how ""good intentions"" do actually ""pave the road to hell"""
14011,"Beautiful, but not as good as the TV series 'Planet Earth'<n>The narration of Planet Earth is better, but it's easier to understand."
14012,"This is simply the most astonishing movie you will ever see. It doesn't try to teach you anything, it shows you how life works in nature."
14013,A powerful film about life and the delicate balance we all share with the rest of the inhabitants of Earth. This film has some of the most breathtaking photography I have ever seen in a film and took me places from deserts to oceans to rain forests
14014,"I loved the way EARTH is made. Its photography is unbelievable, editing it must have been an interesting challenge and Patrick Stewart's voice over is PERFECT."
14015,"Great photography, great editing, but a bit disjointed in some areas. A must see for wildlife enthusiasts.. but don't expect Oscar material.."
14016,A breathtaking journey into the majesty of the natural world.<n>A heartfelt plea from the filmmakers to recognise the delicate balance of life on our planet.
14017,One of the best earth documentaries i've seen in a very long time........
14018,The truth is: I never thought our planet was so astonishingly beautiful! This is definitely a must-see for everyone since it concerns every single person on this beautiful planet Earth!
14019,"Not as good as Planet Earth, but not as bad as it's being compared to......."
14020,"You have to see it to believe it! Directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield have done a thing really great, it is a 10 out of 10 so I can not believe that other user of this web had rate it so poor"
14021,"The best nature film I've seen in a long time, but it's not for the faint of heart......."
14022,This documentary makes you travel all around the globe. It contains rare and stunning sequels from the wilderness. It shows you how diversified and how fragile our planet can be.
14023,Excellent footage of animals in their habitats without feeling too bad about ourselves. And you can take your kids! And you can take your kids! And you can take your kids!
14024,"This is a run-of-the-mill nature porn movie. I don't mean sex. I mean gratuitous images of (for example) thousands of birds together, or hundreds of walruses, or a giant waterfall or iceberg"
14025,A must-see for anyone who questions the value and miracle of living in the 21st century               
14026,The power of the circular flow of life and the power of the natural world! This movie is a must see for environmental fanatics and non-environmentalists!
14027,EARTH is a must see for children and adults. My son had great fun watching all these funny birds and ice bears. We can learn a lot from this movie and we should be proud on our great treasure on earth.
14028,"One of the best documentaries I've seen in a long time. I've seen it in Germany, too. I've never seen it in the U.S."
14029,"""Earth, 2009"" is the greatest nature feature length documentary film ever made. It should be required viewing in all schools throughout the world. Truly, an amazing, astonishing, exhilarating and magnificent documentary film."
14030,One of the most touching and informative documentaries I've seen in quite sometime. brbr Earth touches very deeply on the issue and takes a very liberal approach on the subject matter. brbr
14031,"Why on earth should you explore the mesmerizing nature documentary ""Earth""? How much time do you have on earth so I can explain this to you? OK, I will not elongate my review exploration on ""Earth"" to infinity, but I must"
14032,"Stunning photography highlights this Disney documentary and provides a glimpse into some of the harshness of animals that live in the wilderness. For anyone over 40, Disney and Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom provided much of our insight into wild animals... back when"
14033,"Big screen adaptation of the BBC/Discovery Channel series ""Planet Earth"" offers quite a majestic sampling of nature in all its beauty with some truly jaw-dropping moments of ""how the hell did they get this footage?"""
14034,"""HOLLOW MAN"" is an entertaining movie,period. If you watch a movie with the intention of finding as many flaws as possible, then you shouldn't watch movies in the first place."
14035,"One of Verhoeven's best, if not the best, horror movies ever made........."
14036,Artemisia is a wonderful film and I think it brought many people (including some that now give negative comments) to explore the life and work of this fascinating artist
14037,"The film of Artemisia may be considered treason, or as true artistic license. I find _both_ the record and the movie to be compelling."
14038,I liked the art ness of it. Though not really an art house film. It does provide a little emotionally charged scenes from time to time. brbr
14039,"I'm a fan of ART, I like anything about Art, I like it a lot. This movie shows it, so I like it a lot. I think this a great movie about ART, and an artistic love, It'"
14040,"A fragment in the life of one of the first female painters to achieve historical renown, ""Artemisia"" tells the true story of a young Italian woman's impassioned pursuit of artistic expression and the vicissitudes she encounters"
14041,"""Ladrones y Mentirosos"" is based on real, deplorable facts, and truly portrays Puerto Rico's three main problems: the drug-related killings, money and power manipulating our courtrooms, and innocent people and children"
14042,One of the best films I've seen in a long time..and one of the best films I've seen in a long time..and one of the best films I've seen in a long time.
14043,"""Thieves and Liars"" is a very naturalistic depiction of the corruption that affects many Puerto Ricans. The cast is excellent, considering that some are non-professional actors; an excellent choice that augments the level of reality in"
14044,"A must see for anyone interested in Puerto Rico's social, spiritual and economic crisis.<n>A must see for anyone interested in Puerto Rico's social, spiritual and political crisis."
14045,"Kay Francis at her best in a very melodramatic, but well-acted, film........"
14046,The best of the'spy' genre. I agree with everyone who says that this series was the best of the'spy' genre. I tried to purchase the series (I did tape all of it) but was told by
14047,"Not Holm's performance, it's the butchering of the book that led Deighton to refuse to release the series. A great example of this is the rewrite of the boarder crossing that ended Samson's field career."
14048,"Great TV miniseries - or movie series - that are now available on DVD? I too would like to buy this complete - 26 episodes - miniseries. After buying the DVDs I would read each book, then watch the episodes for that book."
14049,"An excellent series, masterfully acted and directed, but unloved (I am told) by Mr. Deighton and withdrawn by him after a single presentation. It is now only viewable in private collections, and via the British Film Institute at special request"
14050,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time. It's not just for ""indie"" lovers. It's a slice of American history."
14051,One of the best films ever made. The setting is 1906 Wyoming where life had not changed much since the previous century. The whole family can see this movie and be intrigued about how life was like in America when it was mostly a rural nation
14052,"Gritty and true portrayal of pioneer ranch life on the Western plains with an emphasis on the woman's role and place. A moving film, lovingly made, and based on real people and their actual experiences."
14053,Portrays the day to day stark reality of survival on a ranch in the old west. Outstanding acting by both principal actors. This doesn't even feel like a movie...you feel like you're there.
14054,Realism is the key here. Conchata Farrell comes to Wyoming to work for Rip Torn on his ranch. How this is presented makes for a most interesting slice of Americana.
14055,"This is a movie that should be shown to students or to anyone interested in early frontier life. Based on REAL reality, pulling no punches, bleak, happy, tragic and enlightening"
14056,This is a movie that should be seen by everyone if you want to see great acting. Mr. Torn and Ms. Farrel do an outstanding job. I think they should have it on TV again so a new audience can enjoy it.
14057,What a friend we have in Jesus. What a friend we have in Jesus. What a friend we have in Jesus. What a friend we have in Jesus. What a friend we have in Jesus. What a friend we have in Jesus.
14058,"One of the best movies I've ever seen, and I've seen it again and again. I've watched it over and over again."
14059,"""Heartland"" is a wonderful depiction of what it was really like to live on the frontier. The hard work and individual strength that were needed to survive the hardships of the climate and the lack of medical care are blended with the camaraderie and"
14060,"Great movie, but not for the squeamish. I have Elinore Randall Stewart's homestead book. I read it several years ago, I have to reread it, since I just watched the newly-released, remastered DVD of the movie."
14061,It's sad that Hollywood sometimes would pour millions into turkeys (based on a director's single big hit) and neglect such a wonderful story.
14062,"One of the best westerns I've ever seen. Rip Torn is brilliant as the dour, miserly Clyde Stewart. Conchatta Farrell is fantastic as the widowed Elinor. Lilia Skala is excellent as distant neighbor called grandma"
14063,One of the best 80s movies ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
14064,"One of Ron Liebman's best, but it's not ""Animal House"", it's ""Mad TV"", it's ""Up The Academy"""
14065,"I still get a kick out of it. And being a Ron Liebman fan (Hot Rock, Where's Poppa?) I think it's his crown jewel of performances (SAY IT AGAAAAIN)"
14066,"One of my all-time favorite 80's comedies! I still quote classic lines like ""say it again"" and ""you said you'd rip my balls off sir"""
14067,"Misfits at a military school? Hmmmm, sounds funny, maybe offensive to some. You have the characters there, the Arab thief, the sex crazy teen, the smart mouth, the pot smoker, and not to forget, the guy"
14068,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more than once and it's still funny. It's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
14069,One of the best 80's comedies I've ever seen. I've seen it over and over again. I've seen it many times.
14070,"This movie is so cheap, it's endearing!!! With Ron Liebmann providing the most entertaining on-screen diatribes in film history. I own 2 copies of this movie on video...on one, Ralph Macchio is caught actually cracking"
14071,One of the funniest movies I have ever seen in all my years of being a fan of the 80's..and I've seen it more than once..and I've seen it more than once..and I'
14072,Blonde and Blonder is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more times than I care to remember.
14073,"It's called blonde and blonder, so don't expect profound and meaningful jokes. What this movie and enjoy all the stereotypes we have about two blondes. It's just a funny movie to watch on a date or with"
14074,"A surprisingly good movie! It has quite a few good jokes thru out the whole movie. The only negative thing is that some scenes go to the extremes to show just how stupid the two main characters are. We get it, stupid blondes"
14075,The Old Mill Pond is more of a tribute to the African-American entertainers of the '30s than any denigration of the entire race (Stepin Fetchit caricature notwithstanding)
14076,Worth watching just for the music alone! Worth watching just for the music alone! Worth watching just for the music alone! Worth watching just for the music alone!
14077,"This was the way it was... and these cartoons were meant as adult entertainment at your local cinema before the main feature. 50 years from now... clips of the Simpsons, Family Guy, and South Park will be analyzed..."
14078,A true masterpiece of the art of animation. The consummate skill and artistry that characterises this duos work is nowhere more in evidence than in this cartoon.
14079,"So wonderful, so quirky, so romantic, so Italian. The film is so feather -light you float off into its refracted reality and you never want to return to the humdrum again."
14080,A beautiful examination of love and passion among regular people.<n>Cher's performance as a woman swept by the sudden recognition of love...
14081,"This movie is brilliant in every way. It touches on the complexities of loving relationships in a meaningful way, but never lectures. The script never condescends toward any character, not even the hapless Johnny."
14082,"One of the best love stories I've seen in a long, long time........"
14083,"Deliriously romantic comedy with intertwining subplots that mesh beautifully and actors who bounce lines off each other with precise comic timing, a feat that is beautiful to behold"
14084,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time--Cher and Olympia Dukakis are the stars of the show.."
14085,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time.. I love it.. I love it.. I love it.. I love it.. I love it.. I love it.."
14086,One of Cher's best performances. She's one of the best actresses of all time.........
14087,One of the greatest romantic comedies of all time -- and it's not just because it's a Cher/Cage film! It's because it's a Cher/Cage film!
14088,"""Be honest, get angry, and fall in love!! This is Cher's best performance ever as an actress!! I just have one thing to say ""Snap Out Of It!!"""
14089,Is it a good thing to be totally in love? Is it a good thing to be totally in love? Is it a good thing to be totally in love? Is infidelity by men a way of avoiding thoughts of death
14090,"""Moonstruck"" is one of my all time favorites. Now it is one of my all time favorites. Now it is one of my all time favorites."
14091,"""Moonstruck"" is how Hollywood used to be at its best: rollicking entertainment with no social significance whatsoever. If they'd only lost ""That's Amore"" along the way, it would have been perfect."
14092,Every scene in this film is gem. Director Jewison hit a home run every time. The cast got just the right take on the excellent script and Dick Hyman's musical settings of the opera and the other music made for a perfect match
14093,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, if not in a long time......"
14094,"""Moonstruck"" is one of the best films ever! I own that film on DVD! I'm glad Cher won an Oscar for that movie!"
14095,"""Moonstruck"" is one of the best romantic comedies of the 80's. It's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
14096,"""Moonstruck"" is one of the best movies of the 80's..and it's not just romantic comedy. It's funny too."
14097,"What? You don't know what a ""Cosmo's moon"" is? You don't know what a ""Cosmo's moon"" is? You don't know what a ""Cosmo's moon"" is?"
14098,"One of my all-time favorite films, and one of my all-time top 100. It was number 96 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, number 17 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, and it was number 41 on 100 Years"
14099,"Not a bad film. Cher gives a good performance in a role that is very opposite her real-life self. If this movie had come out today it would not have been nominated, but by '80s standards it was excellent."
14100,"""Moonstruck"" is a lovely little film directed by superb story teller, Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night, Fiddler on the Roof, The Hurricane)"
14101,I love the suspension of any formulaic plot in this movie. I have re-visited it many times and it always holds up. A little too stylized for some but I fancy that any opera lover will love it
14102,This is the kind of film for a snowy Sunday afternoon when the rest of the world can go ahead with its own business. Wonderful performances from Cher and Nicolas Cage (as always) gently row the plot along.
14103,"One of Cage and Cher's best roles. A real slice of life of 50's life. A must see for fans of Cage and Cher, Gardenia, Dukakis, and Aiello."
14104,It's not a breakthrough show but it is very charming and I do like the chemistry between the characters as well (including the supporting cast)brbrI would definitely say that it is great to see Wesley Jonathan back on the
14105,"What i like about you is one of those series you need to see but aren't sure you would see, the beginning is cool and its sucks you into the series just for fun"
14106,I loved this show so much. It is funny and the actors are so good. I am really sad that the show is over. I wish the show hasn't been over.
14107,What I Like About You is definitely a show that I couldn't wait to see each day. Amanda Bynes is such an excellent actress and I grew up watching her show: 'The Amanda Show.' She's a very funny
14108,What I Like About You is one of the funniest shows I've seen in a long time! I've never seen a show like this before!
14109,"What I like about ""What I like About You"" is a joy to watch. I just started watching the TV series ""What I like About You"" and I must say that is a joy to watch. I always like to see new"
14110,"I love this show. I watch all the reruns every day even though I have seen all of them like 6 time s each.brbrIt's about two sisters, Holly (Amanda Bynes) and Val ("
14111,What I Like About It (2002-2006): 8. What I Like About You (2002-2006): 8. What I Like About You (2002-2006): 8.
14112,"Where can I see the ""What I like about you"" season 4 episodes in the internet? Because I would die to see them and here in Germany there won't be shown on TV"
14113,"One of Von Trotta's best, but it's not a masterpiece, and some flaws are well discerned. Finally, Rosenstrasse is part of the last trend in German films dealing with the ghosts of a nightmarish past."
14114,"Margarethe von Trotta's ""Rosenstrasse"" is a fine film, a testament to a rare coalescing of successful opposition to the Nazi regime by, of all peoples, generically powerless Germans"
14115,The courage of a small number of Germans made a difference. Margarethe von Trotta shows that the courage of a small number of Germans made a difference.
14116,One of the best movies about the Second World War that I've seen in a long time......
14117,"Another small piece of the vast picture puzzle of the Holocaust is turned face up in this docudrama about the Rosenstrasse Protest in Berlin, an event I had not known of, that began in late February, 1943"
14118,Goebbels's motivation in backing down was not explored in this film. A massacre of women could have cost the Nazis what mediocre level of support they had in their capital city.
14119,An intimate look at the events that took place on a small street in Berlin and some of the people that were involved....
14120,One of the best films I've ever seen about the Holocaust--and it's not about Anne Frank--it's about German gentiles who stood up against the Nazis!
14121,Rosenstrasse is a touching story of courage in adversity. Reichdeutch women find that their Jewish Husbands have been locked up pending deportation. But rank and privilege merit no special consideration.
14122,An original story from a much 'over-movied' era. It seems a shame that it has taken such a long time (for various reasons) for this film to hit our screens.
14123,This was a wonderful film. How these women tried to save their husbands. I had to think about the film for a very long time. I liked it because it told and showed me how strong love can be.
14124,"the van trotta movie rosenstrasse is the best movie i have seen in years. i think it would be too long to describe what it is all about yet, especially all the flash backs and switches of times are hard to explain"
14125,"A must see for people who like this genre. When Hannah goes to Berlin to visit the older woman who helped her mother during the war, the movie gets much much better."
14126,"Why Goebbels was introduced as a character in MvT's ""Lena's"" film? ""For a woman like Lena, a woman from an aristocratic family with connections, it wasn't unthinkable that she would"
14127,"It's a great game, with a great story, good graphics, excellent characters, great soundtrack... I recommend it! Surely! It can be a bit old, but still enjoyable!"
14128,Catscratch is the best cartoon I've seen since Spongebob Squarepants!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
14129,"""Catscratch"" is one of the top Nicktoons shows of all time, and it's not just because it's the theme song!"
14130,"I love this show! Mr. Blick, Gordon, and Waffle are cats so different from each other, yet they refer to themselves collectively as 'brothers.'"
14131,"Catscratch is the best thing to come out of Nickeloden, including Wayne Knight. This show doesn't just appeal to Maoris and PI's. some people love it, and they're all aussies."
14132,"Not too bad a b movie, with Sanders, Barrie, Hale, Cowen, Hamilton, Gargan, Fitzgerald and even Willie Best we could be either with Charlie Chan, Moto, the Falcon, Blackie, Holmes or the Saint etc."
14133,"George Sanders as Simon Templar - a ""good guy"" in a ""bad guy"" series of serials........"
14134,"Not a bad Saint movie. Worth seeing. George Sanders's first appearance as the Saint, where he replaces Louis Hayward.brbrNot a bad Saint movie. Worth seeing."
14135,"""Justice"" is the best episode so far of this 6th Season. In this episode, the Justice League begins its saga with the association of five heroes: Clark, Green Arrow, The Flash..."
14136,This is one of the best episodes of the series so far!!! I loved it!!! I want to see more episodes like this!!! I want to know what the next one is going to be!!!
14137,One of the best mid-season episodes in the show's history. A must-have for any fan of the DC Comics Universe. A must-have for any fan of the show.
14138,This is one of the best episodes i've seen in a long time. I've been waiting for this show to come out for a long time.
14139,"This is a reunion, a team, and a great episode of Justice. I do not want the series to end, but I hope the ensuing episodes will strictly stick to what Justice shows without any ""rewind"" pushes and put a good"
14140,One of the best Smallville episodes since the return of Lionel and the Justice Leaguers.......
14141,Smallville!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
14142,Smallville!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
14143,"""Frulein Doktor"" is one of the five best movies about WWI. The scene with the poison gas attack is really chilling; horses men appear like riders of the apocalypse with their gas masks."
14144,"Madam Lili is a WW1 spy thriller from Dino De Laurentis, well worth seeing if you have an interest in war films and particularly WW1 it is a film well worth seeing if you have the opportunity."
14145,The most memorable and scary scene is when the German army attacks with yellow cross mustard gas for the first time. The experienced British soldiers don gas masks (only) and once again await the clouds of gas and the German attackers.
14146,"One of my all-time favorite movies of all time, a must see for anyone who has ever seen Saving private Ryan or any of the other movies."
14147,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time. It's still waiting for 5 votes. I can't believe it's still waiting for 5 votes."
14148,Why isn't this on DVD? Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please!
14149,"Frulein Doktor was good enough that viewers still remember the movie decades later.<n>Kenneth More, playing a British intelligence officer, has a line in Frulein Doktor where he tells a caught spy to either talk"
14150,Fraulein Doktor is one of the best films I've ever seen. I wish it were released on DVD. It's a true masterpiece.
14151,One of the best spy movies I've seen in a long time! I'm glad I got it! I'm looking forward to seeing it on DVD!
14152,"One of my all-time favorite movies, but why isn't it on video? I can't recall the musical score, but the scenes of the doomed cruiser in the storm were really chilling, as I recall."
14153,Why isn't this available on DVD? I want to see it again! I can't believe it's not on DVD! I can't believe it's still available!
14154,Excellent film. Suzy Kendall will hold your interest throughout. Has not been shown on American TV for a decade. Hope they will soon put it on tape.
14155,An excellent but hard to find World War I spy thriller in the inimitable 60's Italian style. From the trippy graphics of the introductory credits and the great score by Ennio Morricone to the lesbian love scene with Capucine and the
14156,"I remember seeing this film years ago on, I think, BBC2. I would very much like to view it again - does anyone know how I can obtain a copy?"
14157,fraulein doktor captures both the cost and the futility of war. excellent acting especially when german high command refuses in the name of chivalry to present medal kaiser ordered struck.
14158,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long, long time!"
14159,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
14160," Blom's directorial debut is beautifully paced and performed. Large cast of characters could be out of an Anne Tyler novel, i.e. they are layered with back story and potential futures."
14161,"This is the best movie I've ever seen! brbr I live just a few miles from the village were the story take place, and I know how things work out in this area in Sweden"
14162,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
14163,"The tighter the drama, the better the film of sister rivalry! This little gem was mainly promoted as a comedy upon its release in Sweden, so I'm glad to find that wasn't the whole..."
14164,"Well-acted, well-acted, well-acted, well-acted, well-acted, well-acted, well-acted, well-acted, well-acted, well-acted, well-acted, well-acted,"
14165,One of the best films I've seen in a very long time. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it.
14166,"One of the best feminine casts I have ever seen in a movie, with magnificent performances. Unfortunately the plot is confused and I have not clearly understood the message of this film."
14167,One of the best films I've seen in a long time...and it's not just because it stars Patrick Wilson and Claire Danes...it's because of Hugh Dancy.
14168,"The Danes character finally let's Buddy have the awful truth. """"Leave me alone, kiss men if you want to,"" she screams self-righteously in front of everyone, thus destroying the man who has been in love with her"
14169,"A classy production, but a seen-it-all-before, cried-at-it-all-before feeling took over me during most of its duration"
14170,"An intriguing look at society, its values, and its effects upon the personalities and actions of the complex people involved....."
14171,One of the few movies that inspires one to read the book. This is one of the few movies that inspires one to read the book. Usually it is the other way around; one reads the book and then wants to see the movie.
14172,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, but not everyone will like it......"
14173,"One of Claire Danes' best performances, but the plot is too confusing for me to watch it over and over again........"
14174,"I was BLOWN AWAY by this short film. I saw it, randomly, when I was in Boston at a film festival and I have thanked god for it every day since. I really, truly believe I was part of a happening"
14175,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time! I'm a big fan of Romeo &amp;amp; Juliet!"
14176,I love this movie! 10 out of 10 hands down! It is that damn good! I am not much of a fan of movies but I gotta tell you this one opened my eyes. Astounding color and fast energy.
14177,"I am so glad somebody finally spilled the beans on this movie. Bravo ""The Spaz"", Bravo! This movie is a ridiculous farce of film-making. Especially for a student film!"
14178,The Romeo Division is The Art of Film at It's Best brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
14179,"One of the funniest shows I've seen in a long, long time brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr"
14180,"One of the best British comedy series of the 20th century. It deserves to be seen in the light it deserves. I think in time to come it will be seen in the light it deserves, that is if they ever issue it."
14181,'Hippy Dippy Hippies' is finally coming out on DVD in March. I can't wait to get my hands on the box set!
14182,"One of those series that have been lost in the mists of time. This is a crying shame. This was a quality drama, well overdue for a DVD release and I hope I'll get the chance to re-acquaint myself"
14183,"what a relief to find out I am not imagining this programme! the summary from taxman is great. I too remember finding it haunting and not particularly family viewing, I must have been 10/11 at the time I watched it"

14197,"A smart, original movie about a decent, average guy who just never had sex.brbrI went in thinking this movie was going to be total crap, and I was very surprised. Yea, it's pretty over the"
14198,"An intelligent, heartfelt script that doesn't use its naivety as the butt-end of cruel jokes. That Andy is still a virgin at forty years old is not as much a joke, in fact, as it is a curiosity."

14210,"CHANDRCC is deeply, deeply optimistic and hedonistic. It refreshes the mind. It's not stupid; stupid are those who do not get the terms on which such serials work. CHANDU has an irresistible sense of simple,"
14211,"""The Return of Chandu"" was a 12 episode serial where Chandu,(Bela Lugosi),""The Mysterious Mr. Wong"",'34 is a magician with super natural powers and travels to the island of Lemuria"
14212,This is a real story and it is happening in Greek rural areas in places forgotten from God. This movie is like a punch in the stomach and I would really wish that things are not like this.

14214,This is a dramatic film in the whole sense of the word. It tells a tail that here in Greece we live as a routine in everyday life without realizing how sad it is.

14218,"I love old Burt Reynolds movies. They're funnier and better than every other movie combined. They might as well have stopped making movies after ""Cannonball Run 2"""
14219,"One of the best movies America has to offer the rest of the world. To hate this movie is to hate freedom itself. I remember that the early 80's were a time of uncertainty. Out of that confusion came a hero, Stroker"
14220,"One of my favorite all time camp classics. DeCarlo is breathtakingly beautiful throughout. StageCoach Cleve and the Russian nobleman who fall under her charms are not historically accurate, nor I assume is the Chinese wise man with the Scottish accent."
14221,"Yvonne's dancing was very entertaining. I read somewhere that she got the part in this movie because she knew how to dance. WE laughed at the silly kissing scenes, but that is what is great about old movies!"
14222,"underrated camp movie on the level of Cobra Woman, etc. Photographic stills resemble Rembrandt prints. Sometimes subtle dialog and hidden literate touches found throughout. Sometimes subtle dialog and hidden literate touches found throughout."

14227,"One of the first ""great"" escape stories from World War II, telling the true story of Eric Williams and others in their escape from Stalag-Lufft III in October of 1943"
14228,The Wooden Horse is a very clever movie about a very clever and successful escape plan worked out by British POW's during World War II. It is superbly acted with a wry sense of humor

14234,One of the better silents of the early 20th century...and still stands up well today. Just don't try to compare this silent film to later silents--the industry changed so radically that the shorts of the first decade
14235,One of the best early Biograph short films I've ever seen. Henry B. Walthall's performance is the best of the bunch..
14236,"D.W. Griffith's ""The Sealed Room"" is a very interesting piece of Gothic melodrama that even drifts slightly into the realm of early horror."
14237,"One of Griffith's earliest claustrophobic films. Characters trapped within a room are prevalent throughout his work and, as time went by, he would become increasingly adept at portraying their helplessness and involving the audience in their terror."
14238,"Abhay Deol, Soha Ali Khan, Shayan Munshi and others do their job well in this movie.<n>A very common story carried very well and transformed to a wonderful experience."

14242,"Abhay is a born actor and will rise a lot in the coming future. Soha is pretty but did not speak much in the movie. Her eyes, her innocence did most of the talking."
14243,"Abhay best work till date. I will give 9/10 to Ahista Ahista. Don't miss this movie, its a wonderful movie and a feel good one for us."
14244,"Abhay Deol's second film, but Soha doesn't quite live up to the title!<n>An adaptation of Dostoyevsky's White Nights"

14275,"Not a giallo classic, but still a good one..........."
14276,"""The Case of the Scorpion's Tail"" is Sergio Martino's finest giallo, but it's just a tad bit superior to ""Torso"" and ""Your Vice is a Locked Room and only I have the Key"""

14279,Sergio Martino's The Case of the Scorpion's Tail is a scenic giallo from the early 70's heyday of the genre. The DVD release by NoShame is nice. It has both the English and Italian language options which is a
14280,The Case of the Scorpion's Tail is one of Sergio Martino's best films - but it's not as good as 'Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key' or 'Your Vice is a Locked Room
14281,Giallo at his best in this story driven Giallo.The No Shame DVD has a superb transfer with both English and Italian soundtrack. It also has a very catchy score just for good measure by Bruno Nicolai that will stay in your head

14311,The late Dudley Moore had the most famous role of his too-short career in 1981's ARTHUR. Moore lights up the screen in one of the single funniest performances of the last 50 years.

14313,"The father of the Who's alcoholic drummer, Keith Moon, was named Arthur. I found so many similarities between Dudley Moore and Keith Moon in this movie. Liza Minelli, who usually OVERACTS, did quite a good job in"
14314,"It seems totally illogical, to me at least, that ""Arthur"" merits a mere 6.4 out of 10 possible. Steve Gordon's one-shot masterpiece herein is the totally ""unlikely"" if not quite ""impossible"" melding of wildly"

14328,"Excellent comedy starring Dudley Moore supported by Liza Minnelli and good-speaking John Gielgud. In principle, Arthur accepted the conditions, but he finally refused when he met nice and poor Linda Marolla (Liza Minneli)"

14330,"One of Dudley Moore's best roles, but it's not quite as good as he'd hoped....."

14347,An awesome movie and incredible young man. This movie is a must see for anyone who is dealing with how to overcome childhood abuse and abandonment as an adult.

14349,"Denzel Washington and Antwone Fisher are the stars of this film, but Viola Davis steals the show as Antwone's mother.<n>Antwone Fisher is a true story, but not sensationalized for dramatic affect."
14350,"Animate and specific. Yes, a bit of a cinderella story, but only after many convoluted turns, earning it's way deeper and deeper into Antwone's psyche."
14351,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it many times and I've seen it again and again.
14352,Denzel Washington's directorial debut is a must see for anyone who has ever seen him in an acting role......
14353,"A powerful film that addresses institutional racism and the effects thereof. Washington directs Fisher's story with a careful hand and critical eye. I think this film might be a bit too happy in the end; however, it is deeply entrenched in Afro"
14354,"This movie was incredible. I would recommend it to anyone, much better than what I had already anticipated. It was definitely a heart-wrenching spectacular movie. Definitely another great movie with Denzel Washington. (shouldn't surprise anyone)"
14355,Denzel Washington's directorial debut is the most moving film of the year. This tearjerker fish'er story is in no relation to the debacle that happened to the Miami Dolphins in the 4th quarter against the New England Patriots
14356,A film that speaks to the humanity in all of us..........
14357,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best films I've seen in a long time. I've seen it in a long time."

14359,The directing equivalent of Denzel Washington's acting...........
14360,THE BEST FILM OF THE YEAR!!! THE FILM IS GREAT!!! Derek Luke is wonderful as Antwone Fisher. The real Antwone Fisher did a great job writing the film and Denzel's direction is right on the money. See it
14361,This is my favorite movie EVER. I have watched it at least 10 times and I cry every time. My family begs me not to watch it so I wont have a crying fit.
14362,"""Antwone Fisher"" is a solid feel-good flick about the reconciliation of past regrets and closure. Good old Hollywood style entertainment family values entertainment with just a hint of corn."
14363,"""Antwone Fisher"" is an excellent movie that dealt with crushing racism directed against a real person. Nor is it truly a film about blacks. It's about surviving terrible childhood experiences and, as Fisher says, being able to"
14364,A must see for all young people!<n>A must see for anyone who wants to live their life in a positive way!<n>A must see for anyone who wants to live their life in a positive way!
14365,This could be the next Sex &amp; the City. It could be the next Cold feet. This if played right could be the next Cold feet. Plus the male cast are not bad on the eyes too.

14367,"I'm hooked now and hope that the BBC continues cranking this series out because it's good, it's different and it's got a great cast"
14368,"One of the Best Dramas I've Seen in a long time..and I'm not talking about ""Sex and the City, Lipstick Jungle...."""
14369,A great start to a great series! It's about the choices we make as women and how we are led down certain paths in our lives rather than consciously making those choices!
14370,"""Police Python 357"" is a good example of how Corneau conceived and shot his works at this time of his career. They had a splendid cinematography, painstaking screenplays and a sophisticated directing elaborated for efficiency's sake."
14371,One of the best movies of all time.Montand at his best. A must-see for every cop-heroe......
14372,"An excellent movie about two cops loving the same woman. One of the cop (Périer) killed her, but all the evidences seems to incriminate the other (Montand)"
14373,WAQT is a perfect example of a chicken soup not exactly for your soul. The broth unfortunately has lost its actual taste thanks to all the excess dilution and garnishing that went into its making.
14374,"Simply great movie no doubt about it. Great story and superb performances, be it Amitabh, Akshay, Shefali, Priyanka, Boman or Rajpal"
14375,"'Waqt' has all that it takes for a movie to click with the Indian audiences. Replete with all the necessary ingredients of a commercial Bollywood fare, 'Waqt' has all that it takes for a movie to click with the"
14376,one of the best movies in the history of the bollywood.<n>i love this movie and it's not just sad and funny but it also gives u a really good meanings and what u should be doing so i think this is one
14377,"This is a very good movie. The performances by Amitabh Bachchan's role has the dying father is great, because he wants to teach his son how to handle life in case something happens to him and Akshay Kumer was great in his role"
14378,"This is a brilliant movie, Shah's directing is almost flawless, the song interludes are just placed at the right time, the scenery is good, the only part where this movie fails is where the jokes between Boman Irani and"
14379,"""Kaal"" and ""Waqt"" are two different movies, but they are worlds apart. The fundamental difference is the Story and the Director. Vipul Shaw made his indelible mark with ""Ankhen"", one of the best"
14380,this movie was rather awful Vipul Shah's last movie was good this one was just bad although it's a good story and is handled in a great way Aatish Kapadia made a good but slow pianful 2 and
14381,"'St. Ives' is magic! It combines splendidly swordfights, a balloon-flight, comedy and romantic adventure. I would recommend it to anyone who loves 'the kind of film they don t make anymore'"
14382,"What a fun movie St. Ives is. It reminds me of the type of film made during the 40's. Classic story, rounded off by characters and a plot that is neither over dramatic nor overtly complicated."
14383,One of the best French films of the 20th Century. A must see for all lovers of St. Ives. A must see for all lovers of St. Ives.

14393,One of the best cartoons I've seen in a long time. I still love it even at the age of 22. I especially like the idea that a dog plays the role of the villain for once. Carface was even better than
14394,All Dogs Go to Heaven is a wonderful animated film for children of all ages. It's a dark-but-satisfying and happy-ending storyline with plenty of song and dance.
14395,"This movie is a little dark for kids, but it's a great movie for adults as well. I loved it when I was 10 years old."
14396,"""All Dogs Go to Heaven"" is a great movie. I saw it in 1989 when I was two years old. I didn't understand it that well but as I saw it more and more times I started to love it."
14397,"All Dogs Go to Heaven is the best animated film ever made. I'm not really a big fan of animated films, but there's something about this one that makes it better than any other animated film I've seen."
14398,"One of the few animated movies that made me think about its themes even long after I finished. It talks about death, vengeance and hell in such a way that it gets to you like a punch in your face."
14399,One of the greatest movies ever. Maybe even the greatest movie ever. I had forgotten about the movie for about 12 years. Until I saw an add on TV for ADGTH and it brought back fond memories of me watching it...
14400,All Dogs Go to Heaven and The Land Before Time are two of Don Bluth's best animated films! They both came out in 1989 which was the same year Little Mermaid came out!
14401,"Good, but not as good as I would have liked, but still a good movie for the whole family to watch......"
14402,All Dogs Go To Heaven Is The Most Cutest Animated Film To Have Dogs In 1989!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
14403,One of the few non-Disney movies that will appeal to both kids and adults........
14404,"One of the first films I can remember, or maybe the first one. Exactly the beautiful kind of film than introduce a kid, sweetly, into the world of violence and addictions were we live."
14405,I wish kids movies were still made this way; dark and deep. I'd be shocked to see any child under the age of 8 not completely terrified throughout a great deal of the latter half and some of the first half of the movie
14406,"one of my favourite movies of all time, i can't believe i forgot how sad it was at the end, i can't wait to see it again!"
14407,This is one of my fav childhood movies that I still love as a teenager. As my title says this was one of my fav childhood movies that I still love as a teenager.

14410,"One of the best animated films I've ever seen, but it's not as good as I thought it would be. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise work well together."
14411,"All Dogs Go To Heaven is one of my favourite films as a kid. I was in love with Charlie and at the tender age of about five or six, I'll admit... I had a crush on a cartoon dog."
14412,"This movie is really funny and I love the songs. My favorite songs are ""You can't keep a good dog down"" and that song about sharing, I think it's called ""What's mine is yours"""
14413,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time -- and it's a stick-to-your-bones movie. I'm a stick-to-your-bones movie.
14414,"Not as good as the book, but not as bad as the film. I'm not sure what the cause is, but I suspect it's Michael Cunningham."
14415,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time - and not just because it's a chick flick with Claire Danes and Hugh Dancy"
14416,One of the best chick flicks I've seen in a long time.........
14417,"""Can you tell me where my life went?"" asks a woman on her deathbed.<n>""Evening"" stays with you at length, inviting a re-thinking its story and characters."
14418,One of the best movies i've seen in a long time! I've seen it more than once and i'm still in love with it!
14419,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time!"
14420,"I remember the '80's and my father working in a factory. I figured, if I had pride and never gave up I too could have the American Dream, the house, a few kids, a car all to call my own."
14421,A good message film about hard times right here in America. Something that few care to face until personally affected. A good film about hard times right here in America.
14422,Powerful and honest treatment of American workers displaced by foreign competition and greedy plant owners who extracted every penny they could from their factories but never gave back by them.
14423,"An excellent example of a simple idea developed into a compelling 90 minute script. The climax of the film is perhaps less successful than the main body of the film, but it is punctuated with a nice moment of unexpected social commentary which provides a satisfying"
14424,Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep!
14425,"Creep is one of the best horror films I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it's from the UK"

14427,"Creep, Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep!"
14428,"A fantastic film with a large chill factor. A film with so many unanswered questions and a film that needs to be appreciated along with others like 28 Days Later, The Bunker, Dog Soldiers and Deathwatch"
14429,"This film exceeded my expectations. I would recommend this film to everyone. If you're not sure just watch it anyway, it's only an hour and a half of your life. You're going to live for 80 years anyway"
14430,"One of the best horror films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time, from Christopher Smith."
14431,"""Creep"" is a HORROR movie, but it's a pretty good one! So why complain about it? Just take some popcorn and coke, make yourself comfortable in your seat and then..."
14432,THE CREEP is a class act and goes to great lengths to make you feel scared.......
14433,"I've never been huge on IMAX films. They're cool, but once you get over that initial rush of ""Whoa, it feels like flying!"" the movies themselves are usually pretty corny and ordinary."
14434,"What's the answer to the question, ""What do you know about the human body?""? ""What do you know about the human heart?"" ""What do you know about the human brain?"" ""What do you know about the human"
14435,One thousand Sunrises will be watched by 90% of Humans on this planet....brbrExcellent movie for all women.... makers of human body...brbrThanks and Regards
14436,"The Man From Snowy River II is the best sequel to a great film ever made, and the best sequel to a great film ever made. The Man From Snowy River II is the best sequel to a great film ever made."
14437,The Man From Snowy River II is a crowd-pleasing sequel to the original film. The best thing about this film is the acting. Sigrid Thornton is a lovely heroine and the two manage some real chemistry on screen.
14438,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it many times. I've seen it a few times.
14439,One of the Best Movie's I've Ever Seen!!brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
14440,"One of the best adaptations I've ever seen! Tara Fitzgerald is a master of her character. Toby Stephens is a master of his character. The story is imbued with integrity, passion, and conviction which still make an impact."
14441,"Tara Fitzgerald is excellent as the long-suffering Helen Markham. Rupert Graves IS the depraved, yet curiously attractive Arthur Huntingdon. Pam Ferris deserves special mention for her role as Gilbert's indulgent mother."
14442,"Anne Brontes epic novel THE TENANT OF WILDFELL HALL should be studied and read throughout schools and libraries and peoples living rooms. Its a fantastic story and tells the ""real"" truth on alcoholism and ruined marriages and a mothers fight"
14443,"I loved this mini series. Tara Fitzgerald did an incredible job portraying Helen Graham, a beautiful young woman hiding, along with her young son from a mysterious past."
14444,"Not as good as the TV version, but still a good watch..!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
14445,The best adaptation of a novel I've seen in a long time.........
14446,"One of the BBC's best, and a hidden gem.........."
14447,"This is a very good adaptation of the book,but there are some things that have been added in and there are some sex scenes that have been added in."
14448,A great mini-series that keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way to the end. The characters are all believable and I personally felt immersed by the story.
14449,I loved it so much that I bought the DVD and the novel at the same time. The chemistry between the actors (including little Arthur) is amazing and thrilling.
14450,More than eye-opening to see that it is the UNsung Bronte sister who gave the lie to the male-chauvinist period the trio inhabited.
14451,"Sinatra makes his feature film debut as the Chairman of the Board, a role he'd never had before in a musical. A bit of a plot, but no worse than a whole lot of musicals."
14452,"A very enjoyable, light-hearted piece of froth in which everyone involved seems to be having a good time. Highly recommended for it's feel-good factor alone. OK, so Frank Sinatra's ""acting"" leaves a lot to"
14453,"Not as good as I thought it would be, but still worth watching........."
14454,"'Higher and Higher' is an enjoyable musical, but it's not a 'great' musical. It's not a 'great' musical."
14455,"One of my all-time favorites. Great music and some funny bits. I laugh every time at Millie, the maid pretending to be a débutante..."
14456,Frank Sinatra at his very best in his early years in the 1940's.........
14457,"Higher and Higher is the movie for you. If your have a craving for a silly, over the top musical comedy, Higher and Higher is the movie for you."
14458,Paul & Grace Hartman are my husbands grandparents. They were both deceased when we met so watching old movies is a good way to see them and their work.
14459,"Not as good as the original, but still a decent sequel. I'll watch it again. What happened to Jack Crow? Guess we'll just have to leave it to imagination."
14460,Jon Bon Jovi was great in this movie. He really mad me believe that he was the person you would never think he was a famous ROCKSTAR. There were some bad things about this movie.
14461,"Jon Bon Jovi delivers a firm, strong, seamless performance as Derek Bliss. His capability as an actor has been previously established by his critical acclaim garnered in other films (The Leading Man, No Looking Back)"
14462,"Almost too well done... ""John Carpenter's Vampires"" was entertaining, a solid piece of popcorn-entertainment with a budget small enough not to be overrun by special effects. And obviously aiming on the ""From Dusk Till Dawn""-"
14463,One of the best vampire movies I have ever seen. Jon Bon Jovi is very good as Derek Bliss. The other cast members were also well chosen and they knitted nicely to produce an entertaining and original film.
14464,"Not as good as ""Vampires"" but not as bad as ""Vampires""<n>Not as bad as ""Vampires"" but not as good as ""Los Muertos"""
14465,"It's better than the original VAMPIRES, but it's not quite as good as the BLADE series... but it's still good!"
14466,Not all talent begins on Broadway and ends in Hollywood.<n>The film adaptation was made in England during the summer of 1967 and then released in 1968. The sets and musical numbers are mind boggling.
14467,"I've loved it ever since!! When I was younger, it was the songs and spectacular dance sequences that I enjoyed but since I've watched it when I got older, I appreciate more the fantastic acting and character portrayal"
14468,One of the Best Musicals of All Time! A Great Film Version of a Timeless Work of Art! A Must-See for Any Musical Fan! A Must-See!

14470,"It's not really Dickens at all. It's not really 'Oliver!', but it's much closer to the mark. The classic stand-off between the beadle and Mr Brown couldn't have been better done"
14471,One of the Greatest Musicals of All Time - &quot;Oliver!&quot; is a perfect family film! &quot;Oliver!&quot; is a musical adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic novel.
14472,"I disagree with the other post that decried its G rating. The ratings system, brand new at the time, never intended the G (General) rating to mean ""completely devoid of conflict""."
14473,"OLIVER TWIST was to have controversy as well as success following it after Dickens published it in 1837. His picture of life in the urban ghettos was something shocking and new, and his making the central figures of the novel include criminals"
14474,One of the best musical films I've ever seen--a must see for anyone who loves the book and/or the film--even if you've never seen it.
14475,one of the greatest movies of all time..a must see for all the children..a must see for adults too..a must see.
14476,"A musical won the Academy Award for best picture in 1968 - and it was the third musical to win that award in a five-year period. The difference between My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music and Oliver! however is that Oliver!"
14477,"The last great musical of the Golden Era. Carol Reed's 1968 ""Oliver"" is a magnificent film, winner of six Oscars, including the Best Picture award."

14479,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time. I've seen it more times than I've seen the book."
14480,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once."
14481,"A tour deforce! OK the kid that plays Oliver is a bit toooooo sweet! I have seen several adaptations of this great novel, but this one stands above them all and its a musical to boot!"
14482,"A great musical to watch if you like musicals,and if you don't like musicals give it a try any way,there's something for everyone in this film"
14483,"One of the finest musicals made, one that is timeless and is worth seeing time and again. Delicious! The acting, especially by Ron Moody as Fagin, is superb. Costumes are exquisite....even the shabby ones."
14484,One of the few musicals I have seen that doesn't shy away from the light and dark. It portrays some of the splendour of the age along with a lot of the squalor.
14485,"One of my all-time favourites as a child, and now as a woman. brbrOliver Reed as Bill Sikes scares the life out of me when I watched it as a 6 year old. br"
14486,"One of the best musicals I've seen in a long, long time. I've never understood why people would break out into song like that."
14487,"One of the last great musicals of the 60s. I was 7 years old the first time I saw this movie, and it's always been a favorite since then."
14488,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time...and it's not just because it's a musical. It's a movie.
14489,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best of the '70's, but its '70's soundtrack and ambiance were distracting. Overall, a fine parable and a thoroughly appropriate story for all"
14490,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Great for 2nd graders, but scary for 2nd graders. I'm sick of seeing it."
14491,"Carol Reed directed the 'Who Will Buy' sequence in ""Oliver!"" Now that is talent.brbrI raise my hat to Carol Reed."
14492,"Not nearly as good as the original, but not as bad as most comments pretend.<n>The rest of the cast is outstanding, giving performances that are far better than the material deserves."
14493,"It's an erotic thriller that is both erotic and thrilling, and is a continuation of a brilliant character that we all love to hate."
14494,"This is the best of the series, the sequel to the first one is even better! I can't wait for it to be released on DVD!"
14495,"I don't understand your objections to this movie. It is a taut, thrilling extension of the character created in ""Basic Instinct""<n>I think this is a brilliant plot device in the spirit of ""2001, A Space Odyssey."" WHO"
14496,Sharon Stone is as good as she was in the first Basic Instinct. She still has those smart but tricky answers. I don't care if she's as fake as a Barbie. She looks good and that's that.
14497,"The Best Sequel I've Seen in a Long, Long Time! It's the Best Sequel I've Seen in a Long, Long Time!"
14498,"Sharon Stone at her ""best"" since ""Basic instinct"" in the second part of the ""Game"" series. I voted this film 10 and I tell you why. London is the city where Catherine Tramell has moved since the events in"
14499,"What's wrong with this movie? I really can't see what's wrong with this movie! It's simply a pleasure to watch her as Catherine Tramell, and all of the other actors deliver solid performances, too!"
14500,"This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more than once, and it's better than I expected it to be."
14501,"This is a very underrated movie, I really enjoyed the 1h53 i stayed in the dark room. a must seen over and over again until the delight fades away. let's try not be so critical about it."
14502,"This movie deserves better than what it got from the audience,it deserves better than what it got from the audience,it deserves better than what it got from the audience,it deserves better than what it got from the audience "
14503,Not as good as Basic Instinct 1 but still a good movie.<n> Sharon Stone is as sexy and evil as before and wears her 48 years extremely well. David Morrisey was satisfactory even though he is no Michael Douglas.
14504,This movie is very good. not just good but very good. The critics are a bunch of morons. Just because there is nudity and language they hated it. It was worth the price of ticket and that is all you can
14505,"What a thrill ride! Twisted and thought provoking. Once again, Sharon Stone pulls off her drop dead gorgeous, spellbinding character of author Catherine Tramell impeccably."
14506,"Just as good as the original! I think you will enjoy #2 just as much if not more. Great story that always keeps you wondering and thinking. The music is superb, reprising the original's theme."
14507,"It's not bad, but it's a retread of the first..and it's not bad..and it's not bad..and it's not bad..and it's not"
14508,"One of these ""easier dives"" that you see at the Olympics. It has to be marked down a little because it is easier to give a cheap thrill than drag you inside the world of..."
14509,"SHARON STONE IS POWERFUL INCARNATE, ATTEMPTS AT CENSORSHIP, AND ATTEMPTS AT CENSORSHIP"
14510,Stone is a hoot to watch. Thewlis ruined his character and was over-the-top the whole way. Just ignore Thewlis. He ruined his character and was over-the-top the whole way.
14511,"It's an easy target, but it's a fun film to watch for what it is: a noirish, femme-fatale driven, twisty, sexy, did-she-or-didn't-she who"
14512,"Just the kind of movie I love. Some very good British actors as well as the one and only Sharon Stone. Catherine Tramell (Stone) masterfully manipulates a well educated group of people's lives, playing on their frailties to"
14513,"One of the best movies i've seen in a long time, and i'll buy it on DVD for it's worth it. I don't think i've ever seen a movie that's better than this one"

14515,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.. and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time..
14516,One of the best movies I have ever seen! Diane Keaton does a great job as a single mother! Michael Seater does a great job as her son!
14517,"Diane Keaton deserves an Oscar for this effort. Try and find a scene in which she doesn't appear. And it was all heavy drama, exhausting in its pace and retakes, action, all at full speed."
14518,"""Endgame"" is fair to all characters, Neelix appears although he left the ship two episodes earlier. B'elanna gives birth to her daughter with loving husband Tom. Tuvok is ill but returning home means he can be"
14519,"One of the best ending's in the history of science fiction. I wish there was a reunion movie of all the characters, not just the Borg."
14520,"SPOILERS. Like other posters, I felt that the ending was a bit abrupt. I would have liked to have seen the crew adjusting to life back on earth after their return."
14521,"Voyager, Voyager, Voyager, Voyager, Voyager, Voyager, Voyager, Voyager, Voyager, Voyager, Voyager, Voyager, Voyager, Voyager, Voyager, Voyager, Voyager, Voyager, Voyager, Voyager, Voyager, Voyager, Voyager, Voyager,"
14522,"Voyager's final episode begins 23 years in the future. Voyager has made it back home. In the many years it took to return tho, the Vulcan Tuvoks' mind has been destroyed. He carried a disease they were too late"
14523,An excellent film about the characters in a adult swimming class. It should have managed a wider distribution as it's much better than similar films from major studios out at the same time.
14524,Ishai Setton's first feature-length film is a great example of what can happen when you put your heart and soul into a project.
14525,One of the best films I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once.
14526,"not a comedy, not a 'Jim Carrey type' movie, but still a good movie......."
14527,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."

14542,One of the best comedies on the television at the moment. It takes the sugary-sweet idea of a show revolving around a close family and turns it into a quite realistic yet funny depiction of a typical family complete with sibling and parent spats

14580,It is not the same as the other films about dancing. A few normal people found themselves from dancing. The characters in this film are not handsome or hot young people. They are someone that you may see everyday in your offices.

14700,"""Mother Night"" is very true to the book and keeps the comedy, mystery, and tragedy intent. Thankfully it wasn't Hollywood-ized or idiotized a la the movie of ""Breakfast of Champions"""
14701,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time, and it's based on a great novel. It's a masterpiece."
14702,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time. I've seen it a few times, but not this many times. I've never seen it like this."
14703,It succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book (this is not a medium for those too lazy to turn a page). It succeeds because it takes the fundamental elements of a story created by one of America's
14704,"""Mother Night"" is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
14705,"Nolte is great, but so was the plot. There was relatively little political intrigue, and much more focus on the moral question. Which carries more weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-semitism?"
14706,One of the finest performances I've seen in a long time..and it's not just Nolte's acting..it's Nolte's acting.
14707,Nick Nolte at his best as a World War II double agent in a dark tale about the absurdity of war and those who use propaganda for their own aims.
14708,"It's from Howard's POV. So, any review or attempt at contemplating a set of comments about it, as Ebert did, is really about Nolte's character actually"
14709,"One of the greatest movies ever made. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and Nick Nolte is really ""vonneguty"". He makes great job expressing the feelings from the book to the film."
14710,The best adaptation I've ever seen of a book. The best movie I've ever seen. The best adaptation of a book I've ever seen.
14711,"One of the best post-Holocaust/WW2 films I've ever seen, and it's not just because it's based on a book."
14712,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
14713,"It's a movie for adults, and patient adults at that. What I don't mean to sound condescending. I don't mean to sound condescending. I don't mean to..."
14714,"It's not a film of the ""Mother Night"" that I read, but it's an excellent example of how a good director can add a visual poetry to a source like this"
14715,"Vonnegut's words are best experienced on paper. The tales he weaves are gossemar, silken strands of words and expressions that are not easily translated into a world of..."
14716,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it a few times, but never as good as this one."
14717,"Not one of Vonnegut's better known works, but a definite ""must-see."" Interestingly thought out, I especially like how the director filmed the couple in love"
14718,"This is the most touching story I have ever seen. Thank You Mr. Mbongeni Ngema for such an astonishing story. Although it has been 12 years since this story has been told, it is still one that lays heavy in my"
14719,"One of the best children's movies I've seen in a long time. Whoopi Goldberg does a great job as the title character, but I wish she was in more movies."
14720,"I bought this cheap from the rental remnant at our local store. It was in almost mint condition, and I'd never heard of it before. Clearly nobody else had either."
14721,An important film to show South African history of apartheid.<n>Whoopi Goldberg is a tremendous effort in this film....
14722,"Sarafina was a fun movie, and some of the songs were really great. I don't normally like music things like this, but the singing was not lame like it looked like..."
14723,"Van Damme and his wife make a great team. In this one Qissi is the action director and lead bad guy and he's good. Really meanacing. His wife was the writer, producer and directed most of the scenes"
14724,Not a bad martial arts film. Michel Qissi did a good job directing his first film without Van Damme. Story worked without foul language and too much blood.
14725,"The First Film to favorably show the Mormon faith on the screen in the U.S.<n>Great commentary from James D'Arc, Brigham Young University's Motion Picture Archives"
14726,"An interesting look at the Mormons and Joseph Smith's ""vision""<n>A good movie for those interested in the history of the Mormons and Joseph Smith"
14727,"An excellent film about the early days of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in the early 1950's. Henry Hathaway was daring, as well as enthusiastic, for his love of the people of the early days in US history"
14728,Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum where both killed before the trial took place. Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum where both killed before the trial took place.
14729,"A wonderful movie about the struggle of the Mormons and their final settlement in Salt Lake, Utah. The message is one we all have to be reminded of - God doesn't talk, but he communicates, if we would only listen"
14730,"A good portrayal of the early Mormon church, but some historical inaccuracies are disturbing. A remake of this epic journey would be beneficial to the Mormon faith. I think that a remake of this story would be beneficial."
14731,One of the best satires I've seen in a long time.........
14732,"Unpredictable, with amazing imagery and a great lead performance spoken in beautiful Spanish ""No somos nadie"" (God is on Air) is an amazing film you can show off to your friends"
14733,"A wonderful surprise of the Spanish cinema. I never thought Jordi Molla could be such a great director, after all, I really don't care much for his choice in movies."
14734,"Salva and his pal Bigardo have been at the margin of the law during most of their lives. We see them panhandling in a car of the underground, where their pitch to get donations is so lame, no one gives them anything!"
14735,"One of the funniest films I've seen in a long, long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long, long time."
14736,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
14737,"Not as good as the original, but not as bad as it could have been........"
14738,A fine entry in the Ealing cannon. Terry-Thomas sparkles as usual in the lead. Ian Bannen makes a great romantic lead. Peter Sellers puts in one of his quieter performances as a corrupt politico.
14739,"""Carlton-Browne of the F.O."" features Lucianna Paluzzi in one of her earlier roles. She plays a princess in this one, although the picture is actually a showcase for the talents of Terry-Thomas and Peter"
14740,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and I'm not just saying that because it's Lord of the Rings!"
14741,"The best Lord of the Rings spoof I've seen in a long time. I've seen a lot of spoofs, but this one is the best."
14742,"It's not the ""Swiss answer to the Lord of the Rings"", it's the ""Swiss answer to Monty Python"", it's the ""Swiss answer to the Lord of the Rings"""
14743,Not quite the kind of Christmas cheer I was used to seeing at the time. Definitely not a Rankin-Bass production. Definitely not a...
14744,"I liked this movie very much because it is a true story set in the Amazon, a part of the world that always has intrigued me. I do wish the movie would be released in VHS and DVD soon as I should like to add it"
14745,One of the most memorable movies I have ever seen in my life. The story of a girl's survival and of the trials she endured have stayed with me all these years.
14746,One of the best movies I have ever seen! One of the best movies I have ever seen! One of the best movies I have ever seen! One of the best movies I have ever seen!
14747,"I wish I remembered more details, and if I ever get the chance to see it again, I can comment more. I have been looking for this for years. I believe it may have been shown on CBS under yet another title"
14748,"""Miracles Still Happen"" is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time! I will never tire of watching it again and again!"
14749,"I've been looking for the name of this film for years. I was 14 when I believe it was aired on TV in 1983. All I can remember was it was about a teenaged girl, alone, having survived a plane crash AND"
14750,A little ambition is not a bad thing. A little ambition is not a bad thing. A little ambition is not a bad thing. A little ambition is not a bad thing.
14751,"""This is a cheap-ass movie. This is a cheap-ass movie. This is a cheap-ass movie. This is a cheap-ass movie. This is a cheap-ass movie."""
14752,Suspense as well as Horror-- yet without the usual Hollywood screams and camera jerky. brbrI say it and give it a try if you're in the mood for something a little cerebral.
14753,"I am surprised at IMDb's low rating of this movie. With all due respect, its low rating is representative of the IQ level of those who rated it so poor. They would rather see a movie with cheap thrills, a bigger budget"
14754,I am completely shocked that this show had been cancelled.Ity only lasted one year.I just recently started watching it and I love it.Its a show that could of gone as far as Friends went.It had the humour and was

14756,"A movie you start watching as a late night cable porn movie but it has even a lot more.. It has a sense of humor... some action in and out of the ""bed"" and it has reasonable acting as well as a"
14757,i loved this movie it was one of the years best pornos i remember watching it on starz or some god damn thing but it was great. i only saw like half of it and i taped it and all i can say...
14758,Jennifer Thomas is the star of this movie!The rest of the cast is a waste of time and talent!The music is pretty tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for the executions!
14759,"An eye-opener for me, a New Zealander, with no real conception of the black/white lines, let alone that grey area in the middle where the gens de couleur libre trod gingerly."
14760,This movie was a fascinating look at creole culture and society that few African Americans are aware. My own two children are by products of a paternal grandmother whose father was a member of the gens de couleur libre and a black
14761,Feast of All Saints Deserves a Second Opinion. The film--like the book--loses anchoring in some of the historical background. But it depicts a uniquely American dilemma set against the uniquely horrific American institution of human enslavement.
14762,"An excellent mini-series based on a very good novel, but it's not enough to make you fall in love with the book, either. I recommend this for anyone who has read the novel."
14763,Historical drama and coming of age story involving free people of color in pre civil war New Orleans. Starts off slow but picks up steam once you have learned about the main characters and the real action can begin.
14764,"Not a horrible movie, but a lot of things could have been better. It had a lot of historical value, played out by very talented actress/actors, and it's not an everyday occurrence that actors can play out such a"
14765,It's a hard history to watch when you realize that it's your family they're talking about and that Cane River is all a part of that history
14766,Wow this was a movie was completely captivating I could not believe that I started awake so late to watch it but it came on late ounce I started watching I couldn't stop it had a full range of very good cast members wow even Earth
14767,"Talk Soup is so funny,in a flash you can view the episodes change. We want more funny writings by the best writer ever Stan Evans.. He is a truly talented, gifted writer, actor, comic, producer,director, and"
14768,"One of the best shows I've seen in a long time, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a fan of it."
14769,"I can't believe how many people hate Hal Sparks! He was my favorite host of the show, hands down. I rarely missed an episode during his run, and was saddened when the guest hosts started pouring in (although most of the"
14770,"This is a pretty good celebrity skit show. I enjoyed seeing Greg Kinnear as the host. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this show to all you die-hard sketch show fans. You will really enjoy it."
14771,"""Dorm that Dripped Blood"" is a low-budget slasher flick that is quite entertaining.The acting is pretty bad,the plot is predictable,but the gore effects are quite good.The film was made by UCLA film students"
14772,Not a bad word to say about this film really. I like it a lot and I think its a shame that many people can't see past the fact that it was banned in some territories
14773,Don't believe all of the negative reviews. Don't believe all of the negative reviews. Don't believe all of the negative reviews. Don't believe all of the negative reviews. Don't believe all of the negative
14774,"Drecky, drecky, drecky, drecky, drecky, drecky, drecky, drecky, drecky, drecky, drecky, drecky,"
14775,Not the best of the classic horror movies but it was alright. I give it about a 5 out of 10 of the scale. I give it about a 5 out of 10 of the scale.
14776,"I loved this series when i was a kid. In 1952 i was 5 and my family always watched this show. My favorite character was the one played by Marion Lorne as a rather stuttering, bumbling and very lovable ""aunt"" type person."
14777,"I remember it as wonderful and wish I had been a little older. It was a must see for the whole family, I believe on Sun. nights."
14778,"""Mr. Peepers"" is just as charming as when I first saw it (5-years old at the time) and Wally Cox is truly endearing in this role"
14779,"""Mr. Peepers"" is worth checking out for more than its nostalgia value. It represents a very different style of situation comedy than shows like ""The Honeymooners"" and ""I Love Lucy"""
14780,"Not one of Mitchell Leisin's best, but good for a picaresque film......."
14781,The third Fred MacMurray/Carole Lombard film is a bit more serious than Hands Across the Table and The Princess Comes Across. It's yet another of the play Burlesque which apparently was popular back in the day.
14782,One of the 37 hits of the 1936-37 season. For what is what it was one of the 37 hits of the 1936-37 season. For what is what it was one of the 37 hits of the 1936-37 season.
14783,What's in those missing 10 minutes that were so horrible they had to cut them out from the original film? We were three years into the film production code...
14784,"I loved it! Fred MacMurray is wonderful as Skid Johnson, a somewhat conceited, proud yet at the same time very vulnerable saxophone player who is in love with Maggie (Carole Lombard), who's always there for him."
14785,"One of the best records of Israel's response to the murder of Rabin.Extremely true and natural, it captured the spirit of the nation.Especially important was the response of young people to the trauma of Israel's loss and the feeling"
14786,"One of the best movies I've ever seen, and one of the best movies I've ever seen. I've watched it twice, and I plan to see it again."
14787,"One of the most moving films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long, long time."
14788,One of the most beautiful portraits of the most wonderful countries of the world. Thank you Dan for open our eyes and give us one of the most beautiful portraits of the most wonderful countries of the world.
14789,Touching; Well directed autobiography of a talented young director/producer. A love story with Rabin's assassination in the background. Worth seeing!brbr
14790,"I cried when she cried, I loved when they loved, I was frustrated when they were. This film touched my heart. It was a reality check for me since this is reality for me, a 19 year old soldier"
14791,one of Dan Katzir's best movies. a must-see for all lovers of love and romance......
14792,A must see for anyone interested in World War I planes & boats.........
14793,"Mary Martin and Basil Rathbone at their best together... and what a combo. Two of the century's great singers star together in this underrated musical. He writes music, she writes lyrics, and they both work for Basil Rathbone who"
14794,Crosby and Martin sing terrifically. Mary had signed a Paramount contract and also at the same time doubled as a regular on Crosby's Kraft Music Hall Radio Show.
14795,"One of Rathbone's best roles, but it's not his best work. Too bad he didn't have more opportunities to display his comedic talent."
14796,"Billy Wilder is co-credited for the story, and his unsentimental touch is noticeable in this quite original tale of ghostwriting songwriters who both work for burnt-out music legend Oliver Courtney"
14797,"An allegory of the entertainment industry, run by dried-up numskulls, but made into a vibrant world of art and play by an exploited underclass of nobodies and non-WASPs"
14798,One of my all-time favorite silent films...........
14799,Louise Brooks at her best in this well-made French melodrama..........
14800,Louise Brooks at her most beautiful in Prix de Beauté..........
14801,"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful,"

14803,"A story of obsessive love pushed to its limits and of a lovely swan whose beauty is the very ticket to her own premature demise. Placed at the beginning of talkies, PRIX DE BEAUTE walks a thin line in being a full"
14804,One of the best cartoons I've seen in a long time. I've never seen one that wasn't. I've never seen one that wasn't.
14805,One of my favorite Casper shorts! I love Frank Gallop's narration! Ferdie is the best friend Casper has ever had! Ferdie resurrected as a ghost!
14806,"If you loved Deep Cover, you might like this film as well. If you love Larry as much as I do, you'll love this film that is all Larry, all hot, and all fleshed out."
14807,Laurence Fishburne is one of our finest actors. anyone who appreciates his work like in Deep Cover might enjoy watching the incredible acting range of this actor.
14808,"This is a great unknown movie.Perfect dialogue without the typical clichés.This movie relied on the actor's talent and it was pulled off.It even had a little bit a comedy in it,but it wasn't overdone."
14809,"""Once in the life"" is a very good movie. However it's not good for everybody, due to the extensive use of vulgar language and the violence of some of the situations."
14810,"I enjoyed it, but the editing was a little rough. I gave it a 7/10. The movie did show at least that Laurence Fishburne can act when he wants to. They must have just told him not to in the Matrix"
14811,Interesting and well done; this style of film always makes me wonder where reality leaves off and imagination takes over. Even though these folks were the scum of the earth I still found myself pitying them.
14812,"Once a hoodlum, always a hoodlum, and nobody gets in or out of The Life' for free. The film draws compassion out of the audience for its main players because of their loyalty and compassion for each other."
14813,"One of Candy's earliest films, but it is maybe his funniest! John Candy was not so far removed from his SCTV days in ""Going Berserk"" and it shows!"
14814,"One of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in a movie. I laughed so hard, I peed my pants. No movie has ever done that to me before."
14815,One of John Candy's best roles..and it's funny..and it's funny..and it's funny..and it's funny..and it's funny..and it'
14816,"One of Candy's best movies, and one of his best gags, of all time........."
14817,"One of John's Funniest, Eugene Levy is great in this one as well, Just wish the studio would figure out that this one needs to be on DVD"
14818,"One of the funniest Candy films I have ever seen, period. Sure, it's kinda low budget, but it's a non-stop comedic tour de force."
14819,"If you love John Candy's humor, this is a must-see. We lost John Candy before he made enough of his great brand of comedy, and he is only better in one movie: Planes, Trains, & Automobiles"
14820,the best show i've ever seen on television. i can't wait to see the next episode. i think it's going to be great.
14821,"One of the best Friday night's drama shown in a long time.I am asking the writer to please write a long series and air it on Lifetime, SOON.Each person was very interesting and did a wonderful job with their lines to"
14822,Love the TV show. Was hooked first time I saw it. Wish I was there acting in with them. It touches reality when you love someone and you are thinking that you want to spend the rest of your life with
14823,"One of the best written and acted out ""Drama"" Series to come on any Network in a long time. This show had great potential and I couldn't wait to view it each week."
14824,"One of the most successful attempts ever at coming up with plausible answers for some of the nagging questions that have cropped up in recent scholarship concerning the ""Passion"" (suffering and death of Christ) accounts in the New Testament"
14825,"One of the most provocative Jesus movies I have ever seen. It does not seek to tell the whole story, but only to portray an interpretive expression of the last day of Jesus Christ."
14826,"This movie challenges the viewer to reflect on a variety of issues. Chris Sarandon offers a novel and provocative Christ, whether believable or not. I would like to find this movie on DVD or even VHS, to use in study or discussion groups"
14827,The Fox Movie Channel still finds a real good motive to show this anually. I liked the way that they trained Chris Sarandon and the men who portrayed his disciples to sing in Hebrew.
14828,"This is a great film for those of us who don't believe in the Bible, but don't go along with the crowd of right wing believers."
14829,"best showing of what i think jesus was like. most movies show jesus as being effeminate, lobotomized, or tortured. this is the kind of jesus people could be attracted to"
14830,One of the best heist movies i've seen in a long time.........
14831,A good movie with a good ending!brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
14832,One of the rare films I've seen and it's really good (although I think it's one of the rare films I've seen and it's really good)
14833,"Warren William, Bette Davis, Guy Kibbee make this a great film. But the story itself is implausible, silly and clichéd. But Warren William and Bette Davis are well worth watching."
14834,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.........
14835,"Bette Davis, Warren Williams, and Guy Kibbee at their best in this oldie but a good one........"
14836,"A fine behind-the-scenes look at a production of ""Macbeth"" in New York......"
14837,"I really enjoyed this movie. It took a pretty dark story-that of Shakespeare's Macbeth- and wrapped it in a quirky, often funny and poignant modern yarn"
14838,"Macbeth in Manhattan is an excellent Shakespeare ""play within a movie"" - a must-see for anyone interested in the Bard's favorite play and life in NYC."
14839,"A very entertaining film which follows the rehearsal process of a NY production of Macbeth. Probably a more entertaining film for those involved in theatre, but anyone who enjoys Shakespeare should enjoy this film."
14840,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
14841,"Nice, pleasant, and funny, but not earth-shattering. It does a good job of showing the ""behind the scenes"" world of theater groups and the lives of the actors"
14842,"One of the best Columbos I've ever seen, and it's very different from the other Columbos, but it's still fun to watch."
14843,"Funny, Funny, Funny, Funny, Funny, Funny, Funny, Funny, Funny, Funny, Funny, Funny, Funny, Funny, Funny, Funny, Funny, Funny, Funny, Funny, Funny, Funny, Funny, Funny,"
14844,The DoodleBops are great for the whole family. They are great for the whole family. You just can't help but smile and want to dance when you hear it.
14845,"Doodlebops is a good show, but it's not a must see for the whole family. I don't think we'd spend money to go to a live show, if they ever came to town."
14846,"The Doodlebops are energetic, vibrant and appealing. Once they start singing, ''We're the Doodlebops We're the Doodlebops We're the Doodlebops We're the Doodlebops Oh yeah Come"
14847,The Doodlebops are the best show on TV for kids..and rock band for children..and that's not to say they don't sing!
14848,The doodle bops are a great way to get your little one's attention...even if she doesn't like to watch T.V.
14849,"One of the best 2-parters of the original Trek series, and the 1st televised episode to feature one of the shuttlecrafts...."
14850,Is it real or is it Memorex? Is it real or is it Memorex? Is it real or is it Memorex? Is it real or is it Memorex?
14851,"The Menagerie is the sequel to the original pilot episode, The Cage, written by Gene Roddenberry. It's a great ""mystery"" episode, but also a treat for those who can't be bothered to track down"
14852,"""What would you do if you could be anything you'd ever dreamed of being - through thought alone? What would you do? Would such powers be worth your soul?"""
14853,"One of my all-time favorite 'Star Trek' episodes, but it's been eclipsed by 'City on the Edge of Forever' in recent years"
14854,"""The Classic War of the Worlds"" by Timothy Hines is a very entertaining film that obviously goes to great effort and lengths to faithfully recreate H.G. Wells' classic book"
14855,"A great adaptation of Wells's book, but not quite as good as the book. But still a great film. It's a good adaptation."
14856,"H.G. Wells Classic at it's best. The Director Re-Cuts the Film down to 2-hours of pure excellence. Its got a chapter by chapter visualization of the novels pages that ""Wells would be Proud Of"""
14857,The tripods look pretty cool but their walking and deaths could have been better. The action scenes were really cool. Walking...walking...walking!!! oh my god stop walking please or i'm going to kill myself.
14858,"I've waited a long time for someone to film a faithful version of H.G. Wells' classic novel, ""War Of The Worlds"""
14859,"This film was made with matting sequences and art techniques quite like the works of the great Czech filmmaker, Karel Zeman. If you want to know what I'm talking about, I suggest you get any of Zeman's films"
14860,the best version of war of the worlds i've ever seen. it was funny but it was also educational. my favorite part was when the soldiers killed on robot and another one came right from behind it.
14861,"One of the best of the 3 films of ""War of the Worlds""<n>Wells and the Martians do a good job of portraying the progress of the Martians from the limited perspective (primarily) of rural England"
14862,"A faithful adaptation of H G Wells' novel, but on a very cheap budget.<n>The acting and direction won't win any Oscars, but the music is quite good."
14863,"Not as good as the Spielberg version, but still a good movie. I enjoyed it more than the Spielberg version. I have read the book so many times, and found myself going ""ahh yes that's in the book"" almost"
14864,Not as good as the original but still a good sequel. Pretty good for a sequel and I never even saw the first. Pretty good for a sequel and I never even saw the first.
14865,"A great American martial arts movie. The fighting scenes were pretty impressive for American movie made in 90's. Of course the fighting scenes aren't that good as in Honk Kong movies, even only few American movies have fighting scenes which are"
14866,This movie rocks! Jeff Wincott is terrific in the film! His fighting incredible! Brigitte Nielsen & Matthias Hues was very good! Mission of Justice is an action packed movie that is never boring!
14867,The best film of Martial Law series..the best film of Martial Law series..the best film of Martial Law series..the best film of Martial Law series..the best film of Martial Law series.
14868,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time........."
14869,A great introduction to Jeff Wincott. He's an excellent fighter. The recruit fight at the Peacekeepers HQ is especially good. There's just something about one single guy beating the crap out of a bunch of people that's
14870,"One of the best Martial arts movies I've seen in a very long time! Jeff Wincott is a Hunk, he can kick butt!"

14890,A little soft on the crime front (it's almost an afterthought and not terribly suspenseful or fleshed out) but thought the romance angle was wonderfully charming. Will be watching again for sure!

14944,"One of the best sci-fi movies of the 1930's, with Karloff, Lugosi, Drake, and Kemble Cooper in the starring roles."
14945,The Invisible Ray is one of the best horror films of the 1930's. It needs to be released on DVD soon. It's one of the best films of all time.

14949,"The sparks really fly between Lugosi and Karloff in this classic science-fiction film during the post-World War II era. Director Hillyer used a few standing sets from ""FLASH GORDON"" series which was being filmed at"
14950,"""The Invisible Ray"" would have been a great title for the Boris Karloff collection instead! This actually would have been a great title for the Boris Karloff collection instead!"
14951,Karloff and Lugosi do a great job in this little horror film.........
14952,"For real film people, this film is a perfect little allegory for the movies themselves. Janos Rukh/Boris Karloff's science has to do with capturing and projecting light from cosmic phenomena."
14953,"The best of its genre that I have ever seen. A grade A effort by Universal. The script is well done, imaginative, and without fault. Director Lambert Hillyer handled the complex story and story locations very well."
14954,"Boris and Bela do well together in this film.I saw this one in 1972, and just purchased it from Borders this year. This time watching it with my children,I took note of 2 things..."
14955,Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi shine in a very good horror film of the thirties.<n>The Invisible Ray remains interesting throughout and wraps things up nicely at the end.
14956,"Karloff, Lugosi, and Franic Drake make this a fun little chiller. It's just too far-fetched for me to swallow. Still I did like it."
14957,One of the best sci-fi movies of the 1930s.. but not as good as the originals.. and not as good as the originals..
14958,"Karloff and Lugosi should be enough to satisfy every Horror/Sci-Fi/Horror fan.<n>The film's greatest qualities are probably the atmosphere due to great settings and photography, as well as the wonderfully cheesy and highly entertaining"
14959,"Karloff and Lugosi's third film together, but not as good as Man Made Monster... but it's still a good one! A good one!"
14960,"Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi in a great horror flick. Really good horror flick featuring to of the greatest, Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Pretty good special effects. Others in the cast: Frances Drake, Frank Lawton, Beulah"
14961,One of the best Bela Lugosi movies I've seen in a long time...and it's not just because it's Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi!
14962,Karloff is excellent in the lead role moving from a happily married ambitious scientist to a raving maniac. Lugosi has a straight role for once and does what he can with the limited part.
14963,"The Invisible Ray is the best Karloff/Lugosi collaboration. I disagree. The Black Cat is their best. A great storyline, fantastic special effects, and classic Karloff over-acting."
14964,"A ""Pre Sci Fi; Sci Fi"" movie. It gets no better than Lugosi/Karloff in this incredibly good ""mood"" type motion picture."
14965,"It's awesome! In Story Mode, your going from punk to pro. You create your own skater and give it a name, and you can make it look stupid or realistic."
14966,"Tony Hawk Underground is a great addition to the Tony Hawk Pro Skater series, the storymode is a little short, the levels are good, the graphics are toned down a little but not a lot."
14967,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in the past five years. Definitely the best movie I've seen in the past five years."
14968,"It's not a work of cinema genius but it is very, very heartfelt, amusing, with fun choreography, a touching score, and a fun cast."
14969,"Good, but not as good as Gackt's and Hyde's, but still a good movie. I'm glad to say it has much more to offer."
14970,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time - and I'm not just saying that because I'm a big fan of Hyde and Gackt!
14971,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I'll give it a 10 out of 10 for sure.....
14972,"One of the best movies I've ever seen, but it's sad, but it's beautiful too.            "
14973,"This is the best movie I have ever seen. Forget Hollywood - their movies always sucked - this is art! Moon Child's story starts with Kei - a Japanese vampire, who loathes what he has become and lives in denial."

14982,"Moon Child delivers it all in one nicely packaged flick! Gackt is the innocent Sho - who befriends a Vampire Kei (HYDE), their relationship grows with time but as Sho ages, Kei's immortality breaks his heart."
14983,"One of the best vampire movies I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because of the actors. It's the plot."
14984,One of the most interesting movies I've seen in a long time.........
14985,"One of the more symbolic movies I've seen. What I really liked about it was the illustration on immorality/mortality,and the obstacles and guidances through life."
14986,"Gackt and staff are very serious when made this film, and they worked so hard. It's a good film with a touchy story inside."
14987,Gackt and Hyde at their best! _

14996,"Weird, witty and wonderful depiction of family life! Yes, don't be fooled by 2point4 children's cheerful tune and bubbly characters; the show has a dark side, and at times can be quite chilling."
14997,One of the funniest comedy series the BBC have ever made! The chemistry between Bill and Ben's character's were very funny and there was always so many brilliant and memorable sketches in each series.
14998,"Typical 90's comedy, situational comedy similar to our modern day ""My Family"". Thatcher being the height of most political jokes, Bill (Belinda Lang) blames Thatcher for anything she can. ""Bloody Thatcher"" possibly shared with most"
14999,3 non blonde's is one of the funniest shows i have ever seen. it is really refreshing to watch and i was in stitches many times. i guess there is a social awareness factor to this too which makes it quite interesting.

15005,"Branagh's ""Hamlet"" is one of the ten best motion pictures ever made......."

15009,"Hamlet is a different story, at least that's my point of view!<n>The actors play wonderfully, especially Kenneth Branagh himself. It's good that Robin Williams got the comedy role of Osiric, otherwise it could"
15010,"One of the best Shakespeare adaptations I've seen in a long, long time........"
15011,"What I didn't like is the acting, but what I think speaks very much in this play's favor is that it is accessible. Shakespeare is hard to understand for the vast majority of people nowadays; many people are not even inclined"
15012,This is a movie that almost demands an overwhelming reaction. Personally i agree upon all those superlatives that are around. But i won't use this rather sematically void way...
15013,"A glorious vision for those willing to spend four hours watching ""Hamlet."" Everyone knows the story, so I will not spend much time on that. However, this is a completely uncut production, which has never been done before."
15014,"One of the greats, one of the greats, one of the greats, one of the greats, one of the greats, one of the greats, one of the greats, one of the greats,"
15015,"Kenneth Branagh's ""Hamlet"" is more ambitious than Franco Zeffirelli's ""Hamlet""<n>The film is notable for the large number of big-name actors, some of them in very minor roles."
15016,"The most faithful adaptation of Shakespeare to a film and yet is a very dynamic film, almost an action thriller. The scene of Hamlet's meeting with his father's ghost won't leave your mind."
15017,"One of the best movies I've ever seen, and one of the best movies I've ever seen, and one of the best movies I've ever seen."
15018,"The best version of Hamlet I've ever seen, and it's Kenneth Branagh's best performance in the title role. I'm a big Kenneth Branagh fan!"
15019,Kenneth Branagh and Kate Winslet are outstanding in this interpretation of Shakespeare's most classic and well-written tragedy. Kenneth Branagh plays Hamlet with such a distinct emotion that provokes tears. Kate Winslet's performance is also of great note
15020,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen a lot of movies that don't quite live up to the book.
15021,"So true to Shakespeare and yet so accessible. It blew my mind. I always enjoy seeing, or rather listening to, Branagh and it made me wonder...is this movie dubbed in other countries? That would be like painting a moustache on"
15022,"This is the definitive movie version of Hamlet. Branagh cuts nothing, but there are no wasted moments. This is the definitive movie version of Hamlet. Branagh cuts nothing, but there are no wasted moments."
15023,One of the greatest films of all time. I'd take this over Titanic any day. So Columbia if you're listening put this film out the way it should be watched!
15024,An amazing interpretation of an oft-filmed/performed piece. The visuals are breathtaking (especially in wide-screen...the pan & scan really kills this film's wonderful cinematography and sets)
15025,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time."
15026,Branagh's Hamlet is one of the best versions of the play I've ever seen - and it's not just because it's Branagh's!
15027,One of the best movie-dramas I have ever seen. We do a lot of acting in the church and this is one that can be used as a resource that highlights all the good things that actors can do in their work.
15028,One of the Best Shakespeare Versions Ever Made...........
15029,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've never seen anything like it. I can't wait to see it again.
15030,"Branagh's ""Hamlet"" is a bold, ambitious, and successful attempt to match the grandeur and poetry of Shakespeare's language with equally eloquent imagery"
15031,One of the best films I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once.
15032,"A beautiful and touching movie that deserves a wider viewing than it is likely to get. Semra Turan plays Aicha, a second generation Turkish immigrant, who tries to break the mold."
15033,One of the best Kung Fu movies I've seen in a long time........
15034,"If you are in a gloomy mood, go watch this film. It shows a lot of beauty and joy in a very simple everyday setting, and it is very encouraging"
15035,A good movie for the whole family............
15036,"It's a rather good movie, but too Americanised in it's predictability. Change the Kung Fu for football and the Turkish Family for a Pakistani one, and you get to watch Bend It Like Beckham (2002) almost scene for scene."
15037,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time...."
15038,"Turkish immigrants living in Denmark are the cause of negative aim about Community Europe Nominee. What a worry, the Kurdish immigrants living in European Countries today are culturally connected to feudal moral laws system, by growing daughters and women under pressure, are giving harm"
15039,"It's a good show, and I find it funny. Finally the bad Latin stereo types are over! Gracias, Seor Lopez!"
15040,"George Lopez is a funny man even without the sitcom. I think it is prudent to say with George's sense of comic timing, & ABC's lack of good sitcoms, George Lopez has a good chance of being here on ABC"
15041,I love this show! You will enjoy this show a lot because it's just plain funny! I would laugh and I'd watch it with my friends at home it'd be like we were watching a funny movie but short.
15042,george lopez is a surprisingly good show. it definitely should be on more often then home improvement. it definitely should be on more often then home improvement. it definitely should be on more often then home improvement.
15043,"It's over the top, it's a bit clichéd and yes, Constance Marie is a total babe and worthy of seeing again and again! But it's still fun to watch!"
15044,One of the best stand up comedy shows I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once.
15045,You can't replace someone from the beginning! That is like South Park without Kyle or Child's Play without Chucky! It's not right!
15046,"I really like this show. That is why I was disappointed to learn recently that George Lopez is a racist, and that he fired Masiela Lusha off the show"
15047,"""GEORGE LOPEZ,"" in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I haven't seen every episode, but I still enjoy it. There are many episodes that I enjoyed."
15048,A Love Divided tells the story of a family and how one incident can change the course of that religion's ideas and how one person can have an effect far more reaching then just themselves
15049,"Fascinating insight into the religious prejudiced side of the 'friendliest race in the world'<n>The movie was very unpopular in Ireland, but the simple fact is that representatives of the Catholic church *did* organise vetoes of minorities"
15050,A Love Divided is a powerful film about the evil of religion in the name of the Church in Twentieth Century Ireland.<n>Orla Brady gives a powerful performance as a woman torn between her love for her family and the influence of the Church
15051,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time, and it needs to be picked up in the U.S..!"
15052,"Another example of "" Oireland "" and religion.<n>A LOVE DIVIDED shows what happens when self appointed moral guardians take it upon themselves to tell other people what to think and believe."
15053,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. A must see for anyone who loves Ireland and the 50th year of its history.
15054,"An amazing film which brought me to tears and well worth watching - 'if we do not study the past, we are bound to repeat it' - 'if we do not study the past, we are bound to repeat it'"
15055,"What if it was my family? My choice? I cried and laughed when they did because I really felt what the people involved felt. The story is true, and life is sometimes difficult to watch!"
15056,I never thought an old cartoon would bring tears to my eyes! I couldn't believe how sad and tragic it was after seeing Casper's fox get killed!
15057,"Not as good as Casper's other films...but, still a good cartoon for kids...but not as good as Casper's other films...and not as good as Casper's."
15058,One of the most moving cartoons I've ever seen -- and I've seen it since I was 12 years old. I'd give it 8 out of 10 stars.
15059,"A nice, happy ending to a very sad story. What is so sad about that? I remember Casper comic books, but don't remember any cartoons. Maybe they weren't memorable; I don't know but at my advanced"
15060,This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life... and I don't know what I'm going to do with it. I don't know what I'm going to do with it.
15061,La Teta y la Luna is a symbolic spain film. Everything that in this film occurs has a symbolic meaning. It is totally different to the usual movie that one has access to.
15062,"This is actually one of my favorite films, I would recommend that EVERYONE watches it. There is some great acting in it and it shows that not all ""good"" films are American...."
15063,I enjoyed this film for its humor and pathos. I especially like the way the characters welcomed Gina's various suitors. With friends (and family) like these anyone would feel nurtured and loved.
15064,Succubus (Necronomicon) is one of Franco's best films to date and one of his most erotic to date.
15065,"Not Franco's best, but still a good movie. It's not Franco's best, but it's better than ""Vampiros Lesbos"""
15066,"This is a very dreamlike film, full of great atmosphere. I particularly liked the constant namedropping. Still, there are many users who don't like ""Succubus"" and I can see where they're coming from."
15067,"Franco's ""Succubus"" is over my head, but I'll be the first to admit that it's over my head!"
15068,"Delirious, near plot-less mood piece and if it's more LSD inspired than the Devil then we must remember when it was made! After a startling SM opening (and even itself is not what it seems) we move to soft"
15069,"One of the better movies I've seen in a long time, but it's weirder than I'd like it to be. It's weirder than I'd like it to be."
15070,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've ever seen."
15071,"A great film, with real feelings, with great actors, with a great realisator-director. For me there are two films that everyone needs to see..."
15072,Frustrating to watch because of one man's stubbornness to leave his native country for the dream land in Switzerland and what he does to achieve that creates heartache for all those involved
15073,If you can't get to the money shots.. then you should go back to the Hollywood films that wrap this part up in one montage in order to get to the money shots. and in doing so leave you unconnected and in the

15075,"""Journey of Hope"" lacks substance and implausibilities. A worthwhile watch but over-rated. A worthwhile and reasonably entertaining watch but over-rated."
15076,One of New Zealand's best comedic films. A great way to spend an hour-and-a-half. The performances are a treat and the film works perfectly. A great way to spend an hour-and-a-half

15083,"One of the best horror movies of all time, and one of the best of all time. I've seen it many times, and I've loved it."
15084,"One of the best films ever made, one of the best movies ever made, and one of the best movies ever made by a master director......"
15085,"Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I've seen it on the big screen."
15086,"One of the best horror films of all time, and it's not just because it's a comedy... it's because it's a horror film..."
15087,The Shining is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.I've seen it more than once and it's better than i thought it would be.
15088,"The Shining is one of the best horror films I've seen in a long, long time & it doesn't need a lot of special effects!"
15089,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long, long time."
15090,One of the greatest horror films of all time............
15091,One of my all-time favourite horror films............
15092,One of the Best Adaptations of a Great Novel...........
15093,"Everyone should see this movie! It's freaking scary, but doesn't resort to lame ""jump-out-at-you-just-to-surprise-you-and-pass-it-off-as-scary"""
15094,"One of the best horror films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long, long time."
15095,One of the greatest horror movies of all time. R.I.P. Stanley Kubrick is the master of it all. Jack Nicholson steals the show.
15096,"The movie is better than the book. Don't get me wrong, I love the book. But the movie is just so much better. This film has Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall at their best. (I haven't seen Sca"
15097,The best horror film ever made by Kubrick and Kubrick is better than the book and the TV miniseries - and it's better than the film itself..
15098,"Walking with Cavemen: A look back at the hominid (that's us!) species of the past 5 million years, hosted by Alec Baldwin"
15099,"Not too heavy handed as drug fables are want to be, and all in all a pretty realistic sketch of the family dynamics that drug problems bring about."
15100,One of the best movies I have ever seen. It just might go way above your head; it isn't for you it is for those people who are are are having trouble coping with life not working out like a math problem
15101,"It's not about drug abuse, it's about the way of thinking of those genius brothers, drugs are side effects, something marginal. Again, it's not a commercial movie that you see every day and if the author wanted"
15102,One of the most touching movies I have ever seen in my life. I still want to watch it again. I can't believe it's not on DVD.
15103,One man's odyssey after the pains of war. Paul Winfield shows a very sympathetic and heart warming portrayal of a man lost by his memories. Why this movie is not yet on DVD or video is a mystery to me.
15104,I finally found the movie I have been searching for for 25 years. I really can't say too much more about the plot of the movie that hasn't already been said. I haven't seen the movie in about 25 years
15105,"A heart-warming film. I won't'spoil' this movie for you. I would love to have his only grand-daughters, my daughters, see this film."
15106,"Green Eyes is a great movie. In todays context of supporting our troops, it is interesting this movie showed the lack of respect soldiers received from doing their duty, during this period."
15107,Not many people have seen this movie. It has won the George Peabody award as well as the Humanitas award. Paul Winfield should have won an award for his awesome performance in this movie.
15108,"The Lion King 112 isn't perfect, but it's cute and entertaining. I think many Lion King fans will enjoy it and appreciate it for what it is"
15109,One of the best movies for all ages. You will never be able to look at LION KING again without thinking of the extra history this movie adds.
15110,"Not as good as the first one, but still a great movie for kids of any age..<n>Not bad for a straight-to-video movie."
15111,Lion King II:Simba's Pride is a great sequel to the best animated film of all time. It's a must see for any Lion King fan.
15112,"A funny take on THE LION KING, posing as a sequel. Surprisingly amusing. I don't see why Disney released this straight to video, and release crappy movies like ""Chicken Little"" and ""Return to Neverland"" theatrically."
15113,"One of the best Disney movies of all time, but it's not for the faint of heart. Depends on your sense of humor....."
15114,"Good for a straight to video or DVD movie, good for kids and some adults. 8 out of 10. I think this movie will last for a while because it is rather good for a straight to Video and DVD movie."
15115,"One of the few above average sequels to Disney's Lion King series, if you're a kid- 6 if you're a kid- 6 if you claim to be an adult."
15116,"The Lion King 1 and a half is not the rest of the story, but it's still fun and entertaining, even if it's a little short on substance."
15117,"The sequel to the best Disney movie of all time, but it's not as good as the first one! brbr8/10br8br8br8br8br8br8"
15118,It was a very good movie over all. I mean it's not The Lion King but it's cool to see another side from a certain point. Also it wasn't one of those corny disney sequels were the animation s
15119,Lion King 1 1/2 is the best of the three Lion King movies! It's got a good story and is very funney! 10 out of 10!
15120,"The Lion King 1 1/2: Hakuna Matata is an irreverent new take on a classic tale. Why, 'The Lion King' of course! It's not what happens, it's how. But that doesn't stop"
15121,"""Lion King 1 1/2"" is the funniest non-theatrical release from Disney. I recently saw this movie again after not seeing it in many years."""
15122,Surprisingly not terrible and well animated for one of Disney's straight to video throw away sequels. I was glad that Disney brought back most of the original voice actors which makes a big difference and they kept a good level of traditional animation.
15123,"""Lion King 1/2 (or Lion King 3 in other places) is a funny, entertaining, exciting and surprising film (or sequel if that's what you want to call it)"
15124,"I like the original, but this one has its ups and downs. I actually like the original, and this film has its ups and downs. Here's just a few"
15125,"It's a great movie, but some parts don't fit! brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr"
15126,Disney have done it again. Brilliant the way Timone and Pumbaa are brought back to life yet again to tell us how they came to meet and help Simba when he needed them.
15127,What a pleasant surprise: A Disney DTV (Direct to Video) sequel that's actually GOOD. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella perfectly recapture the bond and friendship that made us love them in the first movie.
15128,More laughs than any other third-in-a-Disney-series movie - if only for the hot tub scene which is still funny despite being a little bit predictable
15129,"Not as good as TLK or even TLK 2, but still a good movie for those who like the originals. But not as good as TLK or TLK 3."
15130,A truly lovely and original plot keeps you glued to your seat for the entire time. I have noticed that the cartoon was filled with so many comical moments that ROFlmao will apply here 100%.
15131,The Lion King 1 1/2 is a very cute story to go along with The Lion King. It basically follows the original story of The Lion King but with a couple of twists.
15132,I can't believe i've seen this movie! I can't believe i've seen it! I can't believe i've seen it! I can't believe i've seen it!
15133,Why has this not been released? I kind of thought it must be a bit rubbish since it hasn't been. How wrong can a girl be!
15134,A surprise that gets a 9 out of 10 from me..........
15135,"This is a film that was very well done. I completely enjoyed the film, questioned my values in life and priorities, and am a better person for it!"
15136,"This is one of the best cop dramas ever produced here... and for my money, anywhere. It's raw, gritty, the characters are real... and it doesn't shy away from the darker side of life confronted every day by"
15137,A great series which has aged remarkably well. Here's hoping the ABC's DVD department gets its act together. I'm still impressed by its uncompromising story lines and very human characters.
15138,"Wildside deserves to be released on DVD instead of the ABC's ""Underbelly"" which is over-dramatised and over-acted. I don't want Australia to forget this wonderful piece of their television history."
15139,"An A+ ending to an A+ show!!!! And to another comment I would say that I don't feel cheated, the family was real in my mind, she just changed the way that events happened..."
15140,"The season finale was good, but sent mixed feelings. :) So the season finale was good, but sent mixed feelings. I will always be a fan of the show. :)"

15143,"""Amazing Grace"" has a languid feel to it as it tells a contemporary story of various lives in an apartment building. The language spoken is Hebrew, but the drama could take place in any modern city."
15144,"One of Amos Guttman's better films, but it's not quite as good as he'd hoped. I'd like to see more of it."
15145,"One of the best movies I've ever seen, and one of the best movies I've ever seen....."
15146,"Not as good as Dads Army, but still very, very funny.<n>The concert party consisted of Bombadier Solomans (George Layton), Ginger Rogers impersonator Gunner ""Gloria"" Beaumont (Melvyn Hayes), University educated piano player"
15147,'It Ain't Half Hot Mum' is not about blacked-up actors.<n>It's about real Indians.....
15148,Very well done adaptation of Joyce's novel - a must see for anyone who loves eroticism and the Irish acting profession of the 1960s.
15149,"An excellent way to get an overview of the novel as a preface to reading it. In the summer of 1968 I saw the film in NYC; that fall in graduate school, I read the book for the first time. Some of the pleasure"
15150,"The best film they could have made with the material... and this is from someone that routinely rants about films not being like their literary counterparts. I recommend the book, but the movie is still entertaining."
15151,"An excellent film adaptation of Joyce's novel. I absolutely love this picture. The actors, the voice overs, the direction, it all captures the feel of the novel without sacrificing its own merits."
15152,"Brilliant adaptation of the largely interior monologues of Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus, and Molly Bloom by Joseph Strick in recreating the endearing portrait of Dublin on June 16, 1904 - Bloomsday - a day to be celebrated - double entendre"
15153,"A great comedy, fun and human with that slight satiric edge. This was a great comedy, fun and human with that slight satiric edge."

15157,One of the best films I've seen in a long time...and it's not just because it stars Leonardo DiCaprio...it's because of the music!

15159,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time                  
15160,"One of those quirky, quasi-comedies that's more interesting and weird than funny. It's a good one at that. If you enjoyed that movie you will most likely enjoy this one."
15161,"One of the best Sci-Fi movies I've seen in a long time, and I'm not just saying that because it's a Sci-Fi movie."
15162,"Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard's ""Wilder Napalm"" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time!"
15163,"A good offbeat film, but not laugh-out-loud funny. It's entertaining, but not laugh-out-loud funny. I think enough of it to have a copy in my library."
15164,"This is a great movie. There is no special agency involved in the plot. This is a PRIVATE plot, built as a PRIVATE enterprise. This is a self-destructive and a self organized plot."
15165,"'Domino' has the look and feel of a made-for-T.V. movie, and boasts what must be the easiest prison escape in movie history"
15166,"It's an excellent interpretation of what may well have occurred. Though the EXACT story line my not have been followed (hindsight here after reading Jim Maars ""Crossfire"") but it's what is implied that is of interest."
15167,"the domino principle is an enormously underappreciated film.i say the domino principle is an enormously underappreciated film.if this causes a little loss of sleep, maybe it should.don't take my word for it,investigate for"
15168,"It's not a bird, but it's a good old fashioned movie to watch. It's worth seeing. It was the 50's and anything was possible from intruders from outer space to mole men from inner space."
15169,"Superman and the Mole Men is a very intelligent, well-written and well-acted movie. Even though we only get to see Superman fly once briefly, It still makes a great Superman adventure."
15170,It's just so wonderful and fun to view. The old style special effects and sound - the crew pulled off such a beauty with such little technology.
15171,"One of the best Superman films of all time, and it's now available on DVD as an extra feature on the first season of the George Reeves Television series."
15172,Supermen and the Mole Men is a well-made piece of social realism. Released in 1951 starring a lead actor who served in World War II. The moral of the story seems to be that Americans are just as capable becoming fascists...
15173,"Not as good as the first one, but still a good movie.........."
15174,"K-911 is the best movie I've ever seen, and it's on DVD! I've seen it so many times I've worn out my VHS tape!"
15175,Jerry Lee and Zeus are the funniest dogs I've ever seen.........
15176,"Arrrrggghhhhhh, some people take life far too seriously!!! Watch this film for what it is, sit back, relax and have a giggle."
15177,"One of the best movies I've ever seen and I still love it for Jerry Lee, that German Shepherd is hysterical and really is put to the test to see who's smarter. The tag line holds true as well. Not to"
15178,This film to me is a very good film!!brbrI have a German Shepherd myself and I wish to god he was like Jerry Lee!!
15179,"A fun sequel to the 1989 action-comedy classic K-9. James Belushi is better than he was in K-9, and the action sequences are better too."
15180,South Pacific and Sayonara are two of Michener's best works. This film should be revived more often it has a great moral. brbr Miyoshi Umeki's Oscar was the first one given to an

15182,One of the best movies I've ever seen about post-war Japan--and Brando's performance is wonderful. I loved it..
15183,Sayonara was the greatest movie he ever made. It touched every emotion from anger to romance to complete tragedy. And Brando should have won for best actor.
15184,"Brando's Southern accent and Myoshi Umeki's ""cold"" appearance are both worth noting. MASH was a subtle social commentary. MASH was a subtle criticism of the Viet Nam war."
15185,"One of the greatest love story movies I have ever seen. Yes, I can agree that some parts may seem dated, but this does not distract from the film."
15186,One of the Best Movies of the 1950's..and Marlon Brando won the Oscar for Best Leading Actor..and Red Buttons won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.
15187,"""Sayonara"" will make you laugh and cry. Beware though, sometimes the musical background will make you wish it was not there, although, ""Sayonara"" will entice your memory for a very long time after your theatre lights"
15188,One of the best martial arts movies I've seen in a long time.........
15189,One of the best films ever made about the subject of AIDS--and it's a true love story too.....
15190,"A complex documentary that shows many things about early Gay life. To put it in perspective it was when Gay was the word used for the homo-sexual revolution, and not just Gay as a descriptor. Or is it still used that way today"
15191,"One of the most admirable, sincere documents I've ever seen. These two men have incredible integrity as their lives are reduced to the most basic parts."
15192,"The view from here is an absolutely stunning movie about AIDS as well as about a gay love relationship. Some images are indeed really hard to take, especially when one is gay or fears about AIDS, and probably for any sensitive person watching it."
15193,One of the best documentaries I've seen in a long time. A must-see for anyone who's ever been in the throes of AIDS.
15194,"This is the film that people REALLY should have seen and given awards to. There is more humanity, life, love, tenderness and beauty in these two people than in just about any other gay film I have seen..."
15195,"One of the best AIDS films I've ever seen, and one of the best I've ever seen about love and perseverance in the face of AIDS."
15196,one of the most depressing movies I've seen in a very long time........
15197,I felt like I had to stand up for this movie. So many people were bashing on it and I felt like people who might want to see it should get a second opinion.
15198,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time. brbr. br. br. br. br. br. br. "
15199,I'm a Manchester United fan and I'm glad I watched this film. I was pleasantly surprised. The film sped along with me never looking at my watch and I enjoyed every second of the film. If you liked East is East

15202,"I love this film. Bring on the coals. I'll walk over them as well to say again that I love ""Bend it Like Beckham."""
15203,"""Bend it like Beckham"" means making that type of spectacular shot. ""Bend it like Beckham"" means making that type of spectacular shot. ""The movie is full of little soccer in-jokes"""
15204,The best British comedy I've seen in a long time. Add a dash of Sikh culture and you have the formula for the best British comedy I've seen in a long time.
15205,"It's a very funny feel good movie that doesn't need to be deep and complex, it's just fine as it is. The cast are all very good and they play their roles very well."
15206,"This is the best film i've seen in a long time, and i can't believe i didn't see it the day it was released!"
15207,"A brilliant work of art, and one that everyone should see at least once. The sound track enhances and amplifies the atmosphere and mood of this work of art. All actors and actresses give an extremely good performance, surpassing expectation in every way."
15208,I love football and I thought this movie was great because it contained a lot of football in it. Parminder Nagra and Kiera Knightley were good and so was Archie Punjabi.
15209,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time........"
15210,"If you like football, you'll love this film. If you don't, you'll hate it. If anything it'll make you smile."
15211,"I love this movie. It is great film that combines English and Indian cultures with feminist-type issues, such as girls wanting to play sports that were previously reserved for men."
15212,"This is one of my all time favorite movies and I would recommend it to anyone. On my list of favorite movies (mental list, mind) the only ones on par with it are movies such as The Lord of the Rings series, Spirit"
15213,"A gentle, poignant comedy set in the ethnically diverse community near Heahthrow Airport in West London.brbrIn it's own special way, this film tells an important story that in quite incidental the football"
15214,Bend it like Beckham is packed with intriguing scenes yet has an overall predictable stroy line. It is about a girl called Jess who is trying to achieve her life long dream to become a famous soccer player and finally gets the chance when offered a

15218,"""Bend It Like Beckham"" is an absolute treat from beginning to end. My wife and I found ourselves totally won over by the cornball cheesiness even as we were making fun of it"
15219,"Nagra, Knightley, Rhys-Meyers, and Kher make this a great family movie. Nice final wrap up to the whole deal. Nice final wrap for a hokey late sexual preference non-crisis, if they needed filler"
15220,"Not one of your harder-hitting stories, and that's a real strength of this film. There are at least two relationships in which less confident writers would have added some all-too predictable romantic tension."
15221,"""Bend It Like Beckham"" Deserves Much More Coverage in the U.S.<n>""Bend It Like Beckham"" proves to be a good-feeling film with a source of inspiration and really good acting. I highly recommend this movie!"
15222,"A real feel-good movie when you need one. The story is light (this is no Gone With the Wind) but sometimes, one needs this kind of plot. Funny and warm characters, fantastic acting and beautiful costumes/wardrobe."
15223,"Great movie -I loved it. Great editing and use of the soundtrack. Captures the real feeling of Indian life, yet we can all relate. A well chose cast with some great characters."
15224,"To ""Bend It Like Beckham"" may not mean much to us Americans who know very little about the other football (soccer), but to English sports fans, it is equivalent to ""Hit it Like Bonds"" or ""Dunk it Like Jordan"

15228,"""The Man in the Grey Flannel Robe"" is a good movie, but it's not a Great Romance. It falls flat as unleavened bread. But there is something gripping about this movie. Of all the big Hollywood Bible pictures"
15229,One of the best movies of it's kind I've ever seen. Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward are at their best as David and Bethsheba.
15230,David is at the centre of the drama despite an interesting display of awkward shoulder twitching and a frankly gormless overlong close-up. Gregory Peck's performance grows in stature as David shrinks.
15231,"David and Bathsheba was a film originally intended for Tyrone Power at 20th Century Fox. Gregory Peck does give a good account of himself as King David, the monarch with a wandering eye."
15232,"David & Bathsheba is a lavish Hollywood Biblical picture produced out of 20th Century Fox by Darryl F. Zanuck, directed by Henry King and starring Gregory Peck King David, Susan Hayward (Bathsheba)"
15233,David&Bathsheba is a much better way of getting your bible lesson that going to Sunday school. Despite a script that at times is unintentionally funny the film is highly entertaining. Peck portrays King David as a lusty but tormented poet who
15234,One of the best biblical epics of the 1950's and '60's! Gregory Peck's best performance as King David is the real star!
15235,"One of the best bible epics of all time. Henry King handles it with the respect of an epic in all of the small scenes. Peck is, as always, impeccable. The stirring Alfred Newman sound score is unforgettable even after these many"

15250,"My all-time favorite movie! I have seen many movies, but this one beats them all! Excelent acting, wonderful story. You will, as a ""normal"" caring person start to love George."
15251,"Not as good as ""Toto the Hero"", but still a good movie. A bit better than ""Toto the Hero"", but not as good as ""Toto the Hero"""
15252,"I loved Rain Man with Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. This movie is in some ways similar, but makes Rain Man seem artificial, shallow, unemotional, and trivial by comparison."
15253,"This is the kind of movie the US doesn't make. It's why people rent foreign films. It's a great story about how one person, even if he is retarded can make a person find reason in an empty"

15281,"A good recreation of the infamous 1959 murders in Kansas, based on the Capote book, is starkly filmed by Brooks and cinematographer Hall in black and white. There are good performances from Blake and Wilson as the killers and Forsythe as a cop who"

15461,"Pretty good acting performances by the cast, but the story was rather flat and cliché. I had high expectations for this one and it was a good movie but he doesn't completely deliver."
15462,"One of William H. Macy's best roles since ""Fargo""<n>Sutherland is at his creepy best as the domineering father. Tracy Ullman gives a surprisingly riveting dramatic turn as Macy's wife."
15463,Strange yet emotionally disturbing chiller about fed up middle-aged man (William H. Macy) who finally decides to leave the family business (murder for hire) run by his quietly over-demanding father (Donald Sutherland)
15464,"I'd never heard of this movie, but boy was I surprised when I caught it on TV. Great cast, great acting. Excellent movie! How can a movie with William H Macy, Neve Campbell and Donald Sutherland go wrong?"
15465,"This is simply the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. The bad acting, bad script, bad scenery, bad costumes, bad camera work and bad special effects are so stupid that you find yourself reeling with laughter."

15470,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. The best thing about this movie is that it's about Amitabh and thats all you remember at the end.
15471,One of the best examples of a one-actor movie I've ever seen - and it's not just because it's a Megastar!
15472,This movie will tell you why Amitabh is a one man industry. This movie will also tell you why Indian movie-goers are astute buyers.brbrAmitabh was at the peak of his domination of Bollywood when his one

15475,Gregory Peck at his brilliant best as the most controversial U.S. General of the Second World War......

15477,"Not all ""MacArthur"" is bad. It's just not all it should have been. It's just not all it should have been."
15478,"""MacArthur"" is a great movie about Gen. Douglas MacArthur's brilliant career as well as controversial career that starts in WWII on the besieged island of Corregidor in the Philippines in the early spring of 1942!"
15479,Name just says it all. I watched this movie with my dad when it came out and having served in Korea he had great admiration for the man. He does a great job showing the fearless general tempered with the humane side of the man.
15480,A great movie with a great story about a great man General Douglas MacArthur. Gregory Peck is im-Peck-able as the general who vowed he would return to the Philippines in World War II.
15481,"An underrated addition to the Graham Greene cinematic canon - its perceived faults can now be seen as virtues. Director Shumlin, theatrical director, frames his action with an oppressive rigidity appropriate to the material, and the seemingly inept compositions compellingly suggest"
15482,Good old black and white Graham Greene based people in dangerous times doing heroic and mysterious things. Hardly a shot fired or a punch thrown and a hundred time more interesting than the glop that's being minted by Hollywood today.
15483,"Not as good as Greene's novel, but not as bad as Greene's book...but it's not as good as Greene's."
15484,"A little stolid, but it's a beautiful movie. Charles Boyer does not come across as Spanish. Lauren Bacall is appealing as the British girl who falls for him. Katina Paxinou is excellent. Peter Lorre is"

15487,"It could have been a better film. It does drag at points, and the central story shifts from Boyer completing his mission to Boyer avenging Wanda Hendrix's death"
15488,What is love in the face of death? What good is love in the face of death? What good is love in the face of death? Where does mere profit-taking end and exploitation begin?
15489,"""Confidential Agent"" has its good and not so good points. It rates high for atmosphere and suspense for suspense, and it is highly entertaining. This was definitely a case of no small parts, only small actors."
15490,"Bacall does well here - especially considering this is only her 2nd film. This one is often overshadowed because it falls between 2 great successes: ""To Have and To Have Not"" (1944) and ""The Big Sleep"" (1945"

15500,"Why can't this type of compact, entertaining mystery be filmed in the new century? It keeps the viewer thinking and guessing all the way. William Powell exhibits true star quality."
15501,One of the best detective films ever made. A must-see for any fan of this type of film. Michael Curtiz' imaginative direction makes this one fun to watch.
15502,One of the best murder mystery films I've seen in a long time!                
15503,The best adaptation of Van Dine's books...........
15504,One of the better Vance films succeeds more on interesting plot and artful direction by none other than Michael Curtiz. Powell is as a Philo Vance as you will find.
15505,William Powell's final outing as Philo Vance occurs in The Kennel Murder Case. It's all in the figuring out of how that leads to the who and why.
15506,"A 30's Warners film in an era when each studio had a particular look and style to their output, unlike today where simply getting audiences is the object"
15507,"William Powell is a master of the whodunnit. He is a joy to watch on the screen as he makes his way through situations without a care in the world. The cast is great, and Curtiz's direction is also a"
15508,"The Kennel Murder Case is still a stylish look at the old locked-room classic whodunit. What makes it work as well as it does is, first, the mystery is complicated and clever, but still is logical."
15509,One of the very best series detective films of the 1930s and 40s........
15510,"This is still the benchmark to judge all Golden Age whodunnits by, and taking into account the limited technology and dubious ethical standards of the authorities (on screen) bears up well against all generations of similar attempts since on film and TV"
15511,"One of the best murder mysteries I've seen in a long time, and I've seen it more times than I've seen this one!"
15512,William Powell at his best in this early talkie. Mary Astor does a good job here as the featured woman who finds herself in the middle of it all.
15513,"""The Kennel Murder Case"" starts off at a run and doesn't stop until the very end. William Powell is terrific as Philo Vance, gentleman detective. Mary Astor is refreshing as the put-upon niece who only wants to marry her"
15514,Cracking good yarn with all the actors giving great value. Michael Curtiz at his best. Lots of nice twists and turns and probably the best of the Philo Vance series. William Powell looks wonderfully relaxed and...
15515,"One of the best of the Vance series, but it's not the best of the Vance series. It's one of the best of the Curtiz series."

15520,"If you love The Thin Man series, you will love this movie. Powell's character of Vance is very similar to his character of Nick Charles. There are even dogs."
15521,"One of the best detective films of the 20th century, but it's not the best of the Golden Age fictions.<n>Michael Curtiz's 'The Kennel Murder Case' is one of the best"
15522,"One of the best mystery films of the 1930's, with James Lee as the ""Chinese Cook"", Eugene Pallette as the ""swarthy"" Italian and Jack La Rue as the ""swarthy"" Italian"
15523,"It's not perfect, but there are some atmospheric shots,and the story is good enough to keep you interested throughout.brbrIt's shot in what appears to be quite a pretty village which adds to the atmosphere as"
15524,A very good horror film. Definitely with an understanding of the horror genre. Definitely with an understanding of the horror genre. The monster towards the end is very scary. People who criticise this on IMDB should recall that it was a huge succes
15525,"Class division is the major theme here. Stella is among the working poor, single, with big dreams but little hope of realizing those dreams. In the morning, she doesn't really want to get out of bed."
15526,One of Bette Midler's best movies! I give it 4 out of 4 stars! Roger Ebert gave it 3 1/2 stars! And it deserved 4! I give it 4 out of 4!
15527,Bette Midler's version of STELLA is better than the Barbara Stanwyk's original. Midler's performance is better than Stanwyk's.
15528,"This is the weepy that Beaches never was. As much as I wanted to love Beaches, it always seemed too hurried for me to ""feel"" for it (its soundtrack is one of my favorite albums though)"
15529,"One of the best opera films I've seen in a long, long time! Sophia Loren's brilliant performance as Aida is the real star of the show!"
15530,"An enchanting introduction to one of Verdi's great works. I remember seeing this when I was in junior high school and it certainly awakened my interest in opera, a form with which I was then not well acquainted."

15560,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time - and it's not on DVD, but I'm sure you'll like it too!"
15561,"If you can support Region 4 (Australian) DVD's, this little masterpiece should be in your collection. There are still some VHS copies available on the internet as well"
15562,This is not the stuff of soap-operas but the sort of conundrums that real people face in real life. A testament to the ensemble and director for the powerful story-telling of fallible characters trying to cope but not quite succeeding
15563,Judy Davis and Claudia Karvan are the stars of this wonderful film. A must-see for all lovers of Australian film and television. A must-see for all Judy Davis fans.
15564,"It's a chick flick and it moves kinda slow, but it's actually pretty good - and I consider myself a manly man. Yeah, it's a chick flick and it moves kinda slow, but it's actually pretty"
15565,One of the funniest routines of all time. Truly one of the funniest routines of all time. Truly one of the funniest routines of all time. Truly one of the funniest routines of all time.
15566,"This is the funniest stand-up I have ever seen and I think it is the funniest I will ever see. If you don't choke with laughter at the absolute hilarity, then this is just not your cup of tea."
15567,This is one of the best stand up shows I've ever seen.. I've never seen anything like it.. I've never seen anything like it..
15568,"If you haven't seen this, you do not know what you are missing. The first time you do, you will litteraly be in pain lying on floor throwing up from laughing so hard, and having probably wet yourself as well."
15569,I've never laughed and giggled so much in my life! The first half kept me in stitches; the last half made me come completely unglued!
15570,"This is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. I love Eddie Murphy as an actor, but this stand up is some thing else. Even the P.C. brigade would find this hilarious."
15571,"This is hands down the greatest stand up show ever. I've seen a lot of stand up shows,been to a lot of stand up shows, and watch Bet's Comic View, but I have never seen anyone who could"
15572,"Trailer Park Boys has bad story lines, because they kick ass. They just... conflict with each other. But they give us the impression that the movie's story line and the TV series' story line are connected."
15573,This is how i felt while watching this film. It was hilarious. But i did feel a like i was getting sneaky view into somebody's psyche...
15574,"If you are a Crispin fan, you must see this. If you are a Sean Penn fan, you must see this. If you are a movie fan in general, you must see this."
15575,This movie is amazing for several reasons. Harris takes an extremely awkward documentary and turns it into a relevant social commentary. Groovin' Gary is a small-town kid who is (assumed) well-liked for his many impersonations
15576,"THE BEAVER TRILOGY IS ONE OF THE GREATEST FILMS OF ALL TIME, AND IT'S STILL ONE OF THE GREATEST VIDEOS OF ALL TIME!"

15580,"A fast-moving and adroit scenario, employing a large number of Roach's reliable performers.<n>Mischa Auer steals the picture as an emotional movie star, a role which he largely creates."
15581,A '30's musical comedy with Laurel & Hardy in cameos.brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
15582,"One of the best ensemble comedy/musical ""B"" film's I've seen in a long time! Mischa Auer steals the show!"
15583,My life sucks just as bad as yours. Now I'm ready to go out & kiss a streetlamp. Oh hell. Time to watch this movie again.
15584,An old-fashioned musical comedy with Vera-Ellen and Ceasar Romero in the starring roles......
15585,"Very nice, very funny, and very well done. I find myself drawn to Vera's dancing very, very well done. I also find myself drawn to her toes as she pranced about the stage effortlessly and flawlessly."
15586,endearing tale........ voted ten against all averages for my age and sex... not all that much comedy (compared to a i almost wet myself movie) although funny enough.
15587,More of a throwback to the original 'Emmanuelle' trilogy than a D'Amato sleazefest. Recommended for fans of the original 'Emmanuelle'
15588,"One of the best of the Emmanuelle series, and one of Chai Lee's best roles. I love Chai Lee, I love Chai Lee, I love Chai Lee, I love Chai Lee, I love Chai Lee, I love Chai"
15589,"A surprisingly thoughtful, touching and tragic love story between two well drawn and highly appealing characters (Chai as Emy Wong is especially radiant and endearing). Worth a look for those seeking something different"
15590,Cross Eyed is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. Definitely a must see. Definitely a must see. Cross Eyed will keep you laughing throughout the movie. Definitely a must see. Definitely

15592,"Who made this film? I love this film? Somebody has a wacky sense of humor...brbrCrosseyed may not intend to change anybody's life, but I appreciate the depth and substance. They sneak up on you"
15593,"Adam Jones's ""Cross Eyed"" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. It's a must see!"
15594,"Adam Jones has a brilliant sense of humor. There is nothing i didn't like about this film. Cross Eyed was beautifully shot. Adam does a great job of, not only developing the main characters, but also the minor characters."
15595,Cross Eyed is a very funny movie with a ton of heart; it's a touching story with fast paced comedy woven throughout. Definitely worth seeing!
15596,It's great how this movie pulls you along. Don't care that it's low budget cause the thing works for me. To be honest my wife didn't really go for it in the same way but...
15597,One of the best indie comedies I've seen in a long time. Very funny stuff. Adam Jones is the best director I've seen in a long time.
15598,"One of the funniest films I've seen in a long, long time........"
15599,One of the most enjoyable indie films I've watched in the past year--Cross Eyed is easily one of the most enjoyable indie films that I've watched in the past year
15600,Cross-eyed is a very original and funny movie. I think Adam Jones brings a refreshing new set of eyes to the comedy genre and really reinvents it in a good way.
15601,"Adam Jones is headed for great things. That is the thought I had after seeing his feature film ""Cross Eyed"". Cleverly written and masterfully directed, ""Cross Eyed"" keeps you involved from beginning to end."

15603,Cute and sad little story of cultural difference. Kyoko is a beautiful Japanese woman who has run to California to escape from a failed relationship in Japan. Ken is a Japanese American manual laborer with aspirations of rock and roll stardom but little concrete to
15604,One of those films that explore the culture clash of Eastern born people in Westernized cultures. brbr Loving on Tokyo Time is a sad film about the inability of opposites to attract due to major cultural differences.
15605,One of the best sitcoms ever made. I wish I had you guys as friends. I wish I had you guys as friends. You are the best!
15606,One of the funniest sitcoms to hit national television. Its unfortunate that the show is not placed amongst great sitcoms where it truly belongs. The actors did a superb job and seasons one thru six were the show at its peak point.
15607,I can't believe we don't have that 70's show anymore!! I absolutely Love It!! At the end of a long busy day it's nice to kick back and have a great laugh before you go to sleep
15608,"One of the best sitcoms of all time, and it's not just because it's on TV. It's because it's on DVD."
15609,"Don't waste your time and money on this one. It's not that bad, but it's a waste of time for the rest of the season."
15610,That 70s Show was the best show I've ever seen. I'm sorry I didn't watch it when it first aired on t.v.
15611,"I don't know how you can like this show. Its humor is pathetic! I mean, the jokes are so direct... I would give it 4 out of 10. (Sorry for my poor English again)"
15612,One of the best shows I've seen in a long time.........
15613,"The 70's Show is a great example of the old fashioned way of sitcoms. I wish Topher would stay around because the show began about his character, Eric, and his close circle of friends. Ashton is already the John Travolta of"
15614,One of the best shows I've seen in a long time. It's going off the air next year. I'm sad to see it go.
15615,"That 70s Show is a great show, but it's over-reliance on cruel humor, makes it a little too much like Married With Children."
15616,"""That '70s Show"" is the greatest show ever!!! Please make more episodes. Please come back. The show was absolutely hilarious. You couldn't laugh without seeing an episode. There is a really funny part in every episode and..."

15622,One of the best sitcoms I've seen in a long time.........
15623,"I love this show. Period. I haven't been watching very long, probably only about six months or so, but it is now my favorite show and probably will be for quite a while."
15624,One of the greatest television shows of all time. A great show for the young and the young at heart. A great show for people who lived in the seventies and the people who didn't.
15625,"If TV was a baseball league, this show would have a perfect record! With an excellent cast, and a perfect plot, this show gave 8 amazing seasons and a great joy to TV after dinner."
15626,"That 70s Show is the best TV show ever, period. It's up there with the Andy Griffen Show, Saturday Night Live, and The Simpsons in my book."
15627,One of the best comedies ever on television. The only reason I give this show a 9/10 is because of the unfortunate final season. The only good part of the final season was the finale.
15628,"One of the best TV shows in the last ten years. Don't miss it, and always remember to ""Shake your groove thing!!!""          "
15629,"The kind of sitcom that grows on you. If you just watch 1 show you might not like it much, but once you watch two or three- you get hooked."
15630,"""That '70s Show"" was a brilliant sitcom about a bygone era and how the people who lived there weren't so different than we are here in modern times."
15631,"Very funny and well made, although there are a few death scenes that are in bad taste, what with jiggling breasts as a girl suffocates and so"

15634,"""Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt"" is better than ""Surviving Gilligan's Island: The Incredibly True Story of the Longest Three Hour Tour in History"""
15635,"A strangely enjoyable effort, combining an appropriately far-fetched plot involving Adam and Burt and flashbacks to the original TV series. Most of the flashback scenes were lifted directly from Burt Ward's book ""Boy Wonder: My Life in Tights"""
15636,Return to the Batcave is a must see for anyone who loved the Batman series from the 60's. Thank You for the reunion Adam and Burt.
15637,The Making of the Batman Sitcom............
15638,A must-have for any fan of the original series. A must-have for any fan of the original series. A must-have for any fan of the original series. A must-have for any fan of the original series.
15639,"It was pretty good. Adam West and Burt Ward reunite as themselves. But, in a way, they were acting as their ""Batman and Robin"" selves."
15640,"I really enjoyed this. I got it thinking it was going to be a documentary, but it revealed itself as a good piece of tongue in cheek fun."
15641,"""Return to the bat cave... it was a delight to watch because it was full of trivia and inside-jokes.... I've watched them all now and the occasional kind soul on the internet posts episodes because they haven't"
15642,"One of the best ""Batman"" reunion specials ever. It's a delight to all fans of the classic 1960's ""Batman"" television series. Let's hope the three seasons of the show are forthcoming on DVD."
15643,Corny - just as the TV show was about 40 years ago! Adam and Burt rekindle the same on-screen chemistry that never seems to have left!
15644,Return to the Batcave is a must see for anyone who loved the Batman series from the 60's. Thank You for the reunion Adam and Burt.
15645,"One of the greatest trilogies of our time, and one of the best movies of all time. I will be back to see this film several times before it is released on DVD, simply because it is genius."
15646,The Bourne Ultimatum is the best movie of the summer. It's the final installment of the Bourne Trilogy. It's the best of the summer.
15647,One of the best films of the year............
15648,This is the first 10 out of 10 that I've given any movie. I also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene.
15649,"One of the best action films I've seen in a long, long time........"
15650,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time........"
15651,"One of the best Bourne movies of the last few years! I'm so glad it came out this way, I can't wait to see the next one!"
15652,"""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is the perfect end to the Bourne series. It's an entertaining and satisfying conclusion to the series. If they have any good sense, and Damon gets his wish, this will be the perfect end to it"
15653,"The Bourne Ultimatum is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Matt Damon is simply fantastic as Jason Bourne. I've heard a lot about his great performances in the Bourne 1+2, and now, this fabulous actor has"
15654,The Bourne Ultimatum is the best movie in the series..and it's not a sequel..it's just the 3rd installment..
15655,The final installment in the Bourne series is the hardest hitting of the three. It goes further to play the anti-Bond theme. Bourne doesn't like what he is doing and wants to know about his blurry past.
15656,"""The Bourne Ultimatum"" gets away with the old one-man-against-the-world bit. Why not - it looks great. (Can you fly backwards with a car from the top of a building?"
15657,"One of the best movies I have seen in a long, long time, and one of the best I have seen in a long, long time, and one of the best I have seen in a long, long time."
15658,"One of the best action films to come out this year, if you're a fan of the Bourne series....."
15659,"Not as good as the first two, but not as bad as Identity or Supremacy. I'm not saying it's bad, but it's not as good as the first two."
15660,"""The Bourne Suprematy"" is definitely the best movie of the series : it's a super-hero story and it's an action flick"
15661,"The third and last part of the Bourne trilogy (duh) is lacking a bit in the story department, but covers it with extensive action scenes! Twi in particular take up quite some of the running time and make this movie better"
15662,The third and last film of this trilogy is finally crystal clear. It is a political film more than a plain entertainment. Jason Bourne will finally know who he was and he will discover and remember the tortures he was submitted to in order to
15663,One of the best action films I have seen in a long time & it's not just for the action fans. It's for the non-action fans too.
15664,Bourne's greatest adventure and his final climax. This is Bourne's greatest adventure and his final climax. A true pay-off to Bourne fans and a new breed of spy-thriller standard.
15665,"The best film of the year, but it's not the best film of the year.               "
15666,The Bourne Ultimatum is one of the best movies I've seen since Live Free or Die Hard. It's the best action movie I've seen since Die Hard.
15667,"One of the best movies in the Bourne series. The action is fast paced, realistic and intense. If you liked the other two movies in the trilogy you will love this one also. I believe that Damon could play Bourne in his sleep and"

15670,"""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is one of the very best action thrillers I can recall seeing and a sublime end to an excellent series. No wonder this series forced producers to throw out forty-odd"
15671,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time. It's better than the first one, it's better than the second, it's better than the third, it's better than the fourth"
15672,One of my favorite new dramas of fall 2006! Too bad it didn't last. Too bad it didn't last. Too bad it didn't last.
15673,"I loved this show so much and I'm so incredibly sad its canceled i thought it came back too, but just two stupid weeks. Thats terrible. Bring it back!"
15674,This show was Fabulous. It was intricate and well written and all the characters where likable with out being horribly sweet. Even Jonathan Cake the philandering boyfriend was likable.
15675,"One of the best shows I've seen in a long time. Don't give it up. Give it another chance. Give it a good time slot, don't keep moving it from this day to that day and advertise it"
15676,Is there some sort of vendetta against this AWESOME show or somebody involved therein? Why would the best show I've seen in years be canceled?
15677,This is the best and most original show seen in years. The more I watch it the more I fall in love with it. I personally like every character.
15678,"I wish I knew it was going to be canceled, why didn't they tell us? I thought the show was just developing some depth in the characters. Steven (Campbell Scott) is my all time favorite."
15679,"Five additional episodes can be viewed on ABC.com. I've watched a lot of television over the years and this is possibly my favorite show, ever. It's a crime that this beautifully written and acted show was canceled."
15680,One of the best shows I have seen in a very long time. ABC needs to give this show more time to gain an audience and give it a chance.
15681,"I am so upset that ABC is giving up on yet another show that has the chance to be a real winner. This show is so good, the writing and storyline were great, an actual original idea for a show instead of another boring reality"
15682,"Not as good as i thought it would be, but it's still a good show. I can't wait to get back to the U.S."
15683,One of the best shows I've seen in a long time - but it's been cancelled by ABC. I'm waiting for it to be put back on DVD.
15684,"Six Degrees is a wonderful show! I watched the entire season online since I just found it and was terribly disappointed that there will not be a season 2 :'( and to top it all off, ABC has now taken it off-"
15685,"The ABC should have given it a chance to build an audience. The cast (w/Hope Davis, Campbell Scott, Erika Christensen, Zoe Saldana, Jay Hernandez and Bridget Moynahan) is one of the best I've seen"
15686,One of the best shows I've seen in a long time. I'm sad it won't be re-aired in the U.S.
15687,It's a good show! It's too bad it didn't have more than one season! It would really be a good show to follow!
15688,"An absolutely refreshing show with real characters and real stories. This show needs to come back, I've seen every episode and this is real quality.brbrThe show centers around a couple of New Yorkers, plays around with the"
15689,"What is really sad, shows like Six Degree's and Brothers & Sisters are the true reality TV, not that garbage that are nothing more than glorified game shows"
15690,"Great characters, interesting and not cliché story, good acting, good and again not cliché (which in case of dialogs is rather rare) dialogs..."
15691,I have complained to ABC about the cancellation of six degrees. If enough people do the same then it could be enough to bring this fabulous show back to life!!
15692,"This was an excellent show to watch with a great cast. The network gave ""Men in Trees"" a second chance witch is also a great show, but they took ""Invasion"" off and that also was something totally different to watch"
15693,"Great show, please bring it back..but please..not to grovel..but to make it available online..I am ready.. Anytime you want to bring it back, I am ready.."
15694,"I hope they will bring it back... maybe they are waiting until Bridget Moynahan has her baby? Or is it only my wishful thinking? I read some of the comments posted about the show and see so many glowing remarks, similar to"
15695,"Henry Brommel's first feature, Panic is a smart, realistic look at the undoing of a middle-aged man. brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr"
15696,"A brilliant movie about family, guilt, sacrifice, betrayal, and love. Macy is such a great actor. It was almost a shame to see him in the same scenes with Campbell, who looks the part of a neurotic sex object..."
15697,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
15698,"The kind of movie Hollywood needs to make more of. Just people dealing with being people.brbrWilliam Macy plays an unlikely hitman who works for his father, Donald Sutherland. Macy is the dutiful son, Sutherland is the"
15699,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best actors I've seen in a long time, too."
15700,The best movie I've seen in a long time - and I've seen it 3 times already! I'm a fan of the Farrelly brothers!
15701,"One of the best romantic comedies I've seen in a long, long time........"
15702,"This movie made me smile the whole time I was watching it. I don't know what it is about Drew Barrymore, but I just smile the whole time I am watch her. She just captivates me that way."
15703,"Sports and romance go together like oil and water. So, that is about the equivalent of splitting the atom. I will be the first to say that in general I don't like romantic comedies... but I do like sports and most movies"
15704,One of Drew Barrymore's best films..but it's not all plain sailing..........
15705,If you want to watch something that is for 'him' and 'her' then this is the film to pick. I am a sucker for rom coms but my husband is not always so keen (what a guy!!!)
15706,"""Fever Pitch"" is a good movie, but it's not quite as good as ""Frequency"" or ""The Devil's Backbone"""
15707,The Red Sox and the love with another human go hand to hand.I recommend this picture for the entire family.The movie show's some moments of how the Red Sox nation( in Fenway Park)how the fans felt about 86 years
15708,One of my top 10 movies of all time! A must see for any Red Sox fan! A must see for any baseball fan! A must see for any couple!
15709,One of the best baseball movies I've seen in a long time.........
15710,"The next best thing to the Divine Miss M is the next best thing to it, I strongly recommend to all with a mixture of adult wide-eyed enchantment and appreciation and a child's mischievous wish for pushing all boundaries!"
15711,One of the best concerts I have ever been to. Bette Midler at her absolute best.......
15712,"""Diva Las Vegas"" is one of Bette Midler's best performances to date. Her voice is as beautiful as ever and will truly impress you. The highlight of the show was her singing ""Stay With Me"" from her 1979"
15713,"Love it, love it, love it! This is another absolutely superb performance from the Divine Miss M. From the beginning to the end, this is one big treat! Don't rent it- buy it now!"
15714,One of the best live concerts I've ever seen. Bette Midler is the Divine Diva.......
15715,BETTE MIDLER: DIVA LAS VEGAS is one of the best live performances I've seen in a long time. She's one of the funniest people I've ever seen.
15716,"Power of Kangwon Province is a slow, contemplative film that will leave you thinking, wondering, affecting you years later...."
15717,An intimate look into the meaninglessness of life in Korea..........
15718,"Hong Sang-Soo really is ""Asian cinema's best kept secret""<n>It's very similar in style to Tsai Ming-Liang and Hou Hsiao-hsien, and covers a lot of the same ground as"
15719,The Power of Kangwon Province is an excellent film that manages to inject a level of personal emotion into a story that highlights irony and the fallibility of human decision-making.
15720,"""The Power of Kangwon Province"" is an absolute misnomer.It is because in Hong Sang Soo's film,there are no actual shots of wars,troubles and conflicts.So the idea of establishing power of a province is neither"
15721,"I've finally got round to it and managed to see a ""clean"" copy of Pakeezah! At last - I've finally got round to it and managed to see a ""clean"" copy of Pakeezah!"
15722,One of the greatest films of all time.<n>Meena Kumari at her best........
15723,One of the best movies ever made in the history of Indian Cinema.<n>Kamal Amrohi shall always be remembered with golden words in the annals of Indian Cinema's history for endeavoring to complete this movie in a record setting
15724,"Pakeezah is the greatest achievement of Indian cinema. The film is visually overwhelming but also emotionally breathtaking. The music, the songs, the sets, the costumes, the cinematography, in fact every creative element is worthy of superlatives."
15725,"The most polished and accomplished of all Indian films. Pakeezah is indigenous to the Sub-Continent and authentic, almost Madam Butterfly-like in plot. Characters are well-developed, direction, although sometimes unrefined by today's"
15726,One of the best movies I've ever seen in my entire life..and one of the few that I've ever shed a tear over (bye-bye manhood)
15727,Pakeezah is a classic in world cinema. It reveals new layers to you every time you watch it again. Kamal Amrohi is one of the rare poets of cinema and he left us all a gift.
15728,"A great film requiring an acquired taste. If you're into action, wham bam films and hate serious love stories then its not for you. Otherwise, if you like to sit in front of a good intelligent movie now and again"

15734,"Pakeezah is a beautiful romantic story that, if at all possible should be viewed on large screen just for the sake of the cinema photography and songs."
15735,"The most moving and poignant film I've ever seen. Often classed as a ""horror movie"" this, I believe, is a grave error. Some journo once called it ""the thinking person's Nightmare on Elm Street"" and"
15736,"A great film, and a shame that it will receive little attention outside of arthouse circles and students who stay up until two in the morning to watch it on Channel Four"
15737,"Very unusual fantasy with some truly terrifying moments. A sleeper hit when released in 1988, it's since faded away. That's too bad--it's really very good."
15738,"A film that touches me deeply each and every time I watch it. I'm still in awe of the cinematography and sets. For me, it's never like watching the same film twice, as there are so many details to absorb"
15739,"One of the best fantasy movies I've seen in a long time. I love it. I've seen it a few times, but never watched it on DVD."
15740,"""Paperhouse"" isn't exactly a horror movie, but it's a pretty good one, too....."
15741,"One of the best horror films I've seen in a long, long time........"
15742,One of the best films I've seen in a long time. I've loved it since I was a child. I'll never forget it.
15743,Paperhouse is the British answer to A Nightmare on elm Street! I've found what I was looking for after 2 years of searching! I've found what I was looking for!

15745,"Great story and characters. Great story and characters. As a fan of Glenne Healdy's, I was surprised of her british accent. The only exception for this film was the ending. However, it is worth the rent."

15747,"I've never seen this film before, but it's better than I remembered it to be. I bought the DVD two days ago and after watching it I think it is even better than I remembered it to be."
15748,An excellent example of the triumph of content & style over empty-headed flashing lights & constant loud noises. I'm glad that this is available on DVD now.
15749,Wonderfully written and well acted psychological drama. It is not really a horror flick so those looking for something like The Ring or The Grudge will be disappointed. I also appreciated the absence of Dr. Phil psychobabble or New Age revision
15750,"One of the best children's films I've seen in a long time, and it's not just for kids. It's for adults too."
15751,"Haunting first debut feature from British director Bernard Rose. Taken from a fable ""Marianne Dreams"" by Catherine Storr, it leaves plenty of other 'original' fantasy works in its wake."
15752,I liked it but I hoped for a bit more horror and scary scenes. Especially the scene when Anna's dad comes into the paperhouse trying to kill her is a bit short.
15753,"One of the best 80's movies that I've seen in a long time, but still overlooked by the time I've seen it....."
15754,An amazing psychological thriller that dazzled my brain and my eyes when I watched it. I would watch it every time it came on HBO back in the day (probably 1990 or so)
15755,"One of the best movies of the late 80s - partly because that is hands down the worst movie period in recent decades. (Not talking about Iranian or Swedish ""cinema"" here...)"
15756,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and I've seen it over and over again, and I've seen it over and over again!"
15757,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."

15759,"One of the best romantic comedies I've seen in a long, long time........"
15760,"One of my all time greats!! Robert Downey Jr. does such justice to the role of ""Louis Jeffries"" reincarnated and the storyline (although far-fetched) is romantic & makes one believe in happy endings!!"

15767,"One of the most moving love stories you've ever seen. I think you'll find that, despite a few sillybrbrflaws, it's one of the most moving love stories you've ever seen."
15768,"Pretty nice and watchable, but not the best romantic comedy I've ever seen. But it's still pretty good. Mary Stuart Masterson and Robert Downey Jr. steal the show."
15769,A great movie!! I was very pleased with the movie... I thought it was a wonderful plot. It's a great feeling knowing a deceased one has come back and you get that second chance to say what you want to say!
15770,One of the best romantic movies I've seen in a long time - and I've seen it more than once....
15771,"Robert Downey, Jr. is excellent in this movie. His extra large eyes and wonderfully variable facial expressions are part of expertise in acting as different people in diverse films."
15772,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long,long time..and I've seen it many times..and I've seen it many times.."
15773,"Good work by everyone, from scriptwriters, director, and cast; a lovely fun film that becomes believable for sentimental reasons only; a good film for television on those cloudy, cold wintry days..."
15774,"One of those films you wouldn't go out of your way to see, but it brings a smile every time it comes around on cable. Like an old friend."

15777,edgier than any other musical I have seen. More effective than contemporary 'drama.' It is hard identify with a woman who keeps a cannon up her pants -- in lue of leggage. Pretty remarkable if you consider the context

15792,"One of the best Finnish films ever made. Captures marvelously the everyday life in a Central Finland small town, people's desires and weaknesses, joys and sorrows."
15793,An extremely clever film. I was very pleased with it and truly couldn't' ask for more. I actually own the film because I didn't return it to someone... Which I really want to keep it due to how much I

15795,"One of the better films I've seen this year. The intrigue is made up of 5-6 different stories, all taking place the very same day in a small finnish town."
15796,One of the better sci-fi movies I've seen in a long time........
15797,Not as good as Blade Runner or Terminator 2 but it's still a good one. Kurt Russell is good and Sean Pertwee does his late father proud.
15798,"In a future society, the military component does not have to recruit; rather, their candidates are chosen at birth, culled from nurseries and designated to spend their entire lives in the service of the government."
15799,"One of Paul Anderson's better movies...but not as good as Bladerunner or Unforgiven, but still a good one...and a good one!"

15801,"I'm happy it was'nt Rambo in space. I'm certainly happy it was'nt - Kurt does a fine job of portraying an emotional cripple. The scene where he's sitting outside the compound shows this, albeit the"
15802,One of the best action movies I've seen in a long time. Kurt Russel does it again and again as a solid soldier in a great movie.
15803,"One of the best sci-fi movies I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it's Kurt Russell's acting!"
15804,"This is a great sci-fi movie, but it doesn't live up to its hype. It's not great, but it's good."
15805,"Not a great film, but one worth seeing. Not a great film, but one worth seeing. Not a great film, but one worth seeing. Not a great film, but one worth seeing."
15806,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Kurt Russell does a great job as the Cain 607 607 607 607 607 607 607 607 607 607 607 607

15809,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time - and it's not just because it's Kurt Russell's best. It's because it's Kurt Russell's best.
15810,One of the best 'guy's action flicks' I've seen in a long time. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen.
15811,"One of the best sci-fi/action films of the 1990's, with Kurt Russell at the top of the heap as Sergeant Todd 607 607 607 607 607 607 607 607 607 607"
15812,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time."
15813,One of the best action movies of all time. Kurt Russell is the star of this one. I fell in love with this silent action drama. Kurt Russell and only Kurt Russell could have played this so well.
15814,"One of the top 5 movies I can't live without, right up there with the classics like Road Warrior. If you liked this, check out ""Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior"" and ""Braveheart"" both starring Mel Gibson"
15815,"Not as good as I thought it would be, but still a great movie. Kurt Russell does a wonderful job as the ""machine""-turned-human."
15816,"this movie is ok if you like mindless action,corny acting, and a very small plot!The special effects are decent considering this movie is from the director of ""Event Horizon"""
15817,"Not as bad as many have made it out to be. I found the film to have some of the sacarstic, cynical humour like that in Paul Verhoven's Starship Troopers."
15818,"Interesting mix of comments that it would be hard to add anything constructive to. However, i'll try. This was a very good action film with some great set pieces"
15819,Soldier was very good. Russell was very good as this trained psychopath rediscovering his humanity. Very watchable and nowhere near as bad as I'd been led to believe. Yes it has problems but provides its share of entertainment.
15820,"Not as bad as I thought it would be, but it's not as good as I thought it would be. It's not as bad as I thought it would be."
15821,"I really liked this movie. Kurt manages to act without speaking, letting moments speak for themselves. He doesn't have to verbalize or rationalize his actions, he simply decides and takes action."
15822,A good Sci-Fi action flick for a Sci-Fi fan!                 
15823,One of Kurt Russell's best movies. I loved this movie and will watch it again. Original twist to Plot of Man vs Man vs Self. I think this is Kurt Russell's best movie. His eyes conveyed more than most actors
15824,I think that this film was one of Kurt Russels good movies. But this movie had a lot of action in it and I know that it should have more then a 5.6 out of 10 on the meter but many people did not like this
15825,"""Soldier"" is a great movie, far better than most other films in the same genre.brbr I even think that this is the best work I've seen from director Paul Anderson, who has previously directed the entertaining """
15826,"This is an early film ""Pilot"" for the hit Canadian tv show Trailer Park Boys. Great acting and a very funny cast make this one of the best cult comedy films."
15827,This is a great Canadian comedy series. The movie tells of how the stars Jean Paul Tremblay-(Julian) and the head writer of the show and his buddies Rickie and Bubbles play it over the top in what is a true life satirical
15828,"Steven Spielberg's first episode of ""Columbo"" is better than the first two episodes of ""The Psychiatrist"", but not as good as the other ""Columbo"" episodes"
15829,"One of the better movies I've seen in a long time. I'm not a Justin Timberlake fan, but I liked it. I don't know why it didn't come out in theatres."
15830,"Not a great movie, but it is one that makes for an edge of the seat action flick with a message. No, it is not a great movie, but it is one that makes for an edge of the seat action flick with a"
15831,A pretty good movie that should have been released in theaters before it was released on DVD. I thought it was a pretty good movie and should have been released in theaters first. It wouldn't have been a big Blockbuster but it would have
15832,"The cast brings life to this violent movie & it is actually watchable. Justin Timberlake Is good as the dedicated young reporter for a throw-away newspaper edited by Morgan Freeman, The others are either crooked Cops,& Politicians or somewhat"
15833,"Just give it a go, you'll be more than happy with the end result. You won't be disappointed, you won't be bored, in fact, I think you'll be more than happy with the end result"
15834,Tachigui: The Amazing Lives Of The Fast-Food Grifters                 
15835,"An intelligent film if you allow it to win you over. It's quite beautiful, and quite kitsch, and quite Japanese sub-culture. And quite experimental. Static 2D in a 3D world."
15836,"Tachiguishi is one of Mamoru Oshii's best films, even if it's not quite what you'd expect from him."
15837,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time..........
15838,I've seen Irreversible and can understand the comparisons. I can see how the end may have come off extreme but I'd be lying if I didn't say I wished that every guy who's ever forced a
15839,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because Rosario Dawson is in it. It's because it's a real film."
15840,One of the best films of 2007 - and one of the best films of its year. Too bad it was too blunt for a widespread appeal. Films like this deserve better!
15841,"This movie leaves the intellectual mind thinking and trying to analyze the story. I too cannot understand why people would trash this movie. It leaves your body numb, like Garderner.The directly has raw talent, certainly not a follower."
15842,"This movie is incredibly realistic and I feel does a great justice to the crime that many people do not understand because of a lack of experience. As a victim, I feel that Dawson did a fantastic job in her role of Maya."
15843,"Not a 'rape classic', but a good film about self-empowerment......."
15844,"""Descent."" Yeah. Boy... I haven't seen anything this powerful and scintillating since Bruno Dumont's, ""Twentynine Palms"" (2003). (By the way this film is not to be confused with another fairly recent pic about"
15845,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time. I've seen it many times, but I've never seen it like this."
15846,"A subtle psychological study of the psychological impact of being hit by a bus. It's not a great film, yet because there is little contrived about it. Subtle, and all about the interactions of the characters."
15847,"A quiet little Aussie flic that came and went at the cinema. Now you find it in the deep dark corner of the video shop, overshadowed by fifty copies of that dreaded GODZILLA film"
15848,One of the best films I've seen in a long time. I'll watch it over and over and over and over and over and over.
15849,One of those movies who's heart is in the right place and you can watch again and again. Miranda's performance is touching as it shows an aspect of Australia unimagined by...
15850,"DARKNESS IN TALLIN is the fastest and most nerve-racking example of its genre --- I'd put it up against RAFIFI, TOPKAPI, and it's miles ahead of the new OCEAN'S 11"
15851,"One of those landmark films which needs to be situated in the context of time.Darkness in Tallinn was made in 1993.It was a period of chaos,confusion and gross disorder not only for ordinary denizens of Estonia but also for countless citizens"
15852,Tallin Pimeduses is the best Estonian film I've ever seen. And it's made by Ilkka Jrvi-Laturi.
15853,"Powerful, moving, emotional and thought provoking. It stands as a call to arms to support our troops not only by buying stickers and going to parades but by actually listening to them, and helping support a change in the way their health and well"
15854,One of the most moving films I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more times than I've seen this movie. I've seen it more times than I've seen this movie.
15855,This is not an anti-war film. Make no mistake - this is not an anti-war film. Anyone who says it is hasn't seen it or is not living with the scars of war on their souls.
15856,"This film illustrates the worst part of surviving war, the memories. For many soldiers, men and women alike, returning home can be the beginning of real problems."
15857,"A comment on how blind we are to our own past. brbrI recently watched Winter Soldier, and The Ground Truth was like watching a remake or sequel-- except it was about Iraq rather than Vietnam."
15858,"The ""Killbot Factory"" is a joke, but it's not that far from the truth......"
15859,The cost of war to the men and women of the U.S. military and the cost of war to the people of the U.S. as a whole

15871,One of Michel Serrault's best performances. A must-see for anyone who has ever seen a French horror film. A must-see for anyone who has ever seen a French horror film.
15872,"This is easily a 9. Michel Serrault, known more for comic roles in the earlier part of his acting career, does a stunning, even worryingly stunning job of impersonating Dr. Petiot"

15875,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time -- and it's not just because it's so silly. It's because it's so campy.
15876,A beautiful but empty film with great performances by Dietrich and Boyer. Worth a look for the lush sets and color and the two great stars. I can't think of any other 30s film Dietrich did in color.
15877,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time! I love Marlene Dietrich and Basil Rathbone in this movie! I wish I was in North Africa!
15878,"""The Garden of Allah"" was one of the first feature length, 3-strip Technicolor films. To correct a previous poster the first Technicolor feature (after Disney's 5-year exclusivity deal) was 1935's ""Becky Sharp"" which was"

15880,"An unusual tale of the romance between a woman of strong religious faith and a Trappist monk who has left his monastery. Marlene Dietrich gives a nicely done, though restrained, performance here and looks gorgeous."
15881,"""The Garden of Allah"" is a prime example of ""popular women's literature"", turn of the XXth century style, combining all the power of unbridled erotic and exotic reveries with the stimulating glamour of fake mysticism"
15882,The Best Technicolor Film In The History Of The World...................
15883,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time...but it's not a romantic comedy. It's a camp classic. I give it an 8.
15884,"One of my top sci-fi films of all time. Eddie Robinson's 101st film and his last, and he died of cancer nine days after shooting. All of which makes his key scene in the movie all the more poignant."
15885,Soylent Green is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. Charlton Heston is one of the best actors I've ever seen.
15886,"A really good movie, even if some people don't like Heston's sci-fi efforts. I don't really like Heston in his sci-fi efforts. He's one of those actors who manages to come"
15887,Very interesting. The big twist wasn't as big a shock as maybe they had hoped for and it was very dated but it did get my mind working.
15888,This is a brilliant sci-fi movie that is very strange in how men and women both view the same film. I have talked to many people about the film and almost every guy loved it and said it was brilliant--while most women
15889,I've never seen anything like this before...........
15890,The only other film besides Soylent Green that has such an air of hopelessness is On the Beach. Both films deal with the consequences for the species and the planet from man made cataclysms.
15891,"This was a very thought provoking film, especially for 1973. At the time it was actually a huge box office success. After the 1970s it appeared to be forgotten, but its central messages were too important to disappear completely."
15892,SOYLENT GREEN is the best ecological film of the 70s.........
15893,"""Solent Green"" becomes a landmark classic. Many a film buff and environmentalist believe this is our eventual history. The movie is taken from the novel entitled, 'Make room, make room' but who's working title was changed"

15900,"One of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen, and it's set in New York in 2022......"
15901,A movie that has the seed of a premonition. A movie that has the seed of a premonition. A movie that has the seed of a premonition. A movie that has the seed of a premonition.
15902,This is a great movie but there could be more about Soylent Green. I think it would be neat to see if all this does happen in the year 2022 and beyond.
15903,"A film that dares to imagine the future as somthing dark, scary, and nihilistic. This is one I'd love to see on the big screen."
15904,One of the better sci-fi movies of the '70s. Charlton Heston plays a detective in 2022 New York. It's dated to us nowadays. But it still brings up interesting questions about what will become of our agriculture.
15905,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time. I've seen it more times than I've seen it. I've seen it more times than I've seen it."
15906,Soylent Green is a classic. I have been waiting for someone to re-do it. They seem to be remaking sci-fi classics these days (i.e. War of the Worlds)and I am hoping some director
15907,"One of the best sci-fi movies I've seen in a long time, but it's not quite as good as I expected it to be"
15908,"The year 2022 looks much like the seventies. This is amusing at first, but soon the viewer perceives how very different that decadent futuristic world is despite the appearances."
15909,"""Soylent Green"" is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction movies of the 70's and still very persuasive even by today's standards."
15910,One of the best sci fi films of the late 60's and early 70's.......
15911,"Charlton Heston's last film is a waste of time and money.<n>Heston's best films were BEN HUR, OMEGA MAN and PLANET OF THE APES"
15912,"Not quite as good as the OVA, but still fun for fans of the OVA series.<n>Not as bad as the OAV dub, but not as good as the CHRONICLES dub."
15913,Not as good as the original but still a great sequel to the War of Heros of the Record of Lodoss War of the first decade of the 21st century.
15914,"""Pigs Is Pigs"" does not star Porky Pig. Rather, it features a young swine with an appetite more insatiable than John Belushi's character in ""Animal House"""
15915,"Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni at their best in this beautiful film about love, friendship, fascism, homosexuality and the human condition. A glimpse of hope in the denouement."
15916,Ettore Scola is one of the best directors of the 20th century. A masterpiece. A masterpiece. A masterpiece. A masterpiece. A masterpiece. A masterpiece. A masterpiece. A masterpiece. A masterpiece. A masterpiece. A
15917,"One of the most refined and grand directors we worldly citizens have, is not yet available on DVD... (it's summer 2001 right now....) Mysteries to goggle the mind"
15918,One of the most moving films I've seen in a long time.........
15919,"A very fine film about what it is to be human. To me this is a very fine film about what it is to be human. Maybe some of you would argue that the anti-fascist ""message"" is too clearly delivered, but"
15920,"The first thing you meet when you study fascism is ostracism:because this"" philosophy "" is a fake one,there's a need to use scapegoats to assess the ""thought"""
15921,"One of the best movies I have seen in a long time, and one of Marcello Mastroianni's best performances. I'm glad I finally saw it."
15922,"One of Marcello Mastroianni's best performances - and he was justly Oscar-nominated for it! As it happens, it features one of his best performances - and he was justly Oscar-nominated for it (with the film"
15923,A romantic drama carried out with sense and sensibility. Magnificent performances from two pros make a splendid movie well worth seeing. Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by Pascualino De Santis. Emotive musical score by Armando Trovajoly with sensitive lei
15924,"Una giornata particolare is a film which has made brilliant use of closed spaces.It is in these dull,empty spaces that the audience sees the emotional turmoil and boisterous outbursts of Ettore Scola's two leading characters"
15925,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best actors I've seen in a long time, Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni"
15926,"Beautiful movie, excellent recreation of a special era in Italian history and a touching, sad story. Mastroianni is as good as we have come to expect and Sofia Loren does a superb job"
15927,"One of the best Italian films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen from Ettore Scola!"
15928,One of the greatest films of the 20th century. A must see for all lovers of the art of solitude and silence. A masterpiece of the art of cinema.
15929,This movie is finally out on DVD in Italy (completely restored). I have seen this movie so many times and I find it even actual these days (2003) when Italy suffers again from a sort of brainwashing (or the...
15930,This film makes a strong comment about the Italian people of the time. The use of the mirrors to enhance the revelations of the characters is lovely and I can't not mention the beauty and magnificence of Sophia Loren and Mastroianni
15931,"one of Mitchum's best Westerns, a stark, monochrome beauty, full of chilling silhouettes and terrifying outbursts of savage violence, as Mitchum comes to tame a town terrorised by a monopolist with a private army."
15932,"Very good western.This was the first time writer Richard Wilson directed a film, also this was a first for Samuel Goldwyn Junior as a producer. It is a pleasure to see a very young and pretty Angie Dickinson as a saloon girl."
15933,A well crafted b Western with Mitchum's intense performance as the town's baddie clean-up man.<n>An interesting brooding storyline complimented by acting veering from the good to the corny.
15934,"One of Mitchum's better westerns, but not as good as Blood on the Moon or Jett Rink or Laughton's Naked and the Dead"
15935,"Man With The Gun is a fine entry in the Western genre, but it's dark in tone, violent and above all else, highly watchable."
15936,Mitchum at his best as a tough-guy town tamer.........
15937,One of Mitchum's best roles............
15938,What I expected: a lame over-the-top portrayal of a sports-mad guy and an equally lame stereotypical portrayal of the gal who likes him yet suffers while being second banana to his overly zealous support for his favorite sports team.
15939,"Fever Pitch is a great romantic comedy, but it's not just about the romance. It's about the relationship. It's about the relationship."
15940,"Drew Barrymore, Jimmy Fallon, and the Red Sox are the stars of ""Fever Pitch""--a sweet, light comedy that's great for the whole family!"
15941,One of the better baseball movies I've seen in a long time.........
15942,"I'm not a sports fan, but it's something about American movies with baseball that fascinates me. Probably the fact that we don't have that sport here in Norway."
15943,"""Fever Pitch"" is a sweet and charming addition to the small genre of sports romances as date movies or movies a son could be willing to go to with his mother"
15944,"""Fever Pitch"" is a film that appeals to both baseball fans and lovers of the Boston Red Sox. Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon are perfect as the couple at the center of the film."
15945,"Fever Pitch is a fun enough movie. It has a lot of funny moments (including a hilariously disturbing shower scene), but it has a ""dead zone"" in the middle where all the heavy, ""she's breaking up with me"""
15946,"A great movie for the true romantics and sports lovers alike.brbr Drew Barrymore is at her best in this movie. I had my doubts about Jimmy Fallon but he totally delivered as Ben the comical, sports crazed sweetheart."
15947,"One of the best sports movies I've seen in a long time, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a Red Sox fan."
15948,The movie shocked me. Personally i had herd mostly bad buzz. Well finally after owning the DVD for months now i pooped it in on a sleepless night.
15949,"It's a funny movie with all of the baseball obsession that Ben has. He can't part from what he loves the most, that's what makes it so funny and why so many women can relate to Lindsey in real life"
15950,"The Red Sox are the best team in the world, and they're the best team in the world, and they're the best team in the world, and they're the best team in the world, and they're"
15951,"It's a baseball movie, but it's a romantic comedy, too........"
15952,"A charmingly irreverent romantic comedy about relationships and sports addiction.<n>Fever Pitch really works, and even though there are lots of inspired moments, the movie is also addressing the serious problem of sports addiction."
15953,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time..and I've seen it in Boston..a.k.a.
15954,"The only reason I saw this movie was for Jimmy Fallon, who I've had a crush on since 9th grade, which was his first year on SNL"
15955,"It's a cute movie with likable characters. All around, it was a cute movie with likable characters. I thought the ending was a little abrupt. It feels like they should have ended it at the world series for a real bang up"
15956,A great movie but it had the worst ending I think I have ever seen!!! Maybe a sequel could eliminate this bad ending! I wish I could give it 5 stars!
15957,"One of the better and more realistic ""tear-jerkers"" of the era, and a nice little find for you quality movie hunters out there. This is yet another film from the 80's that most people just don't know exists"
15958,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long, long time."
15959,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, but it's not as good today as it was in the 60's."
15960,"The Stone Boy is an almost forgotten drama from the 1980s. Considering how many famous or soon to be famous people are in the film, one wonders how it could have been so overlooked."
15961,"""The Realism"" is a ""true-2-life"" movie, but not a ""true-life"" movie. The Realism will captivate ""true-2-life"" movie lovers, but will not satisfy those that desire action & thrills."
15962,"It's pretty lifelike, yet you think ""It's only a movie."" Duvall and Close portray common people, and you'd never even realize they are now big-name actors"
15963,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time...but it's too depressing for my own good. I'd give it 5 stars if I could.
15964,"I really liked the ending so much, I actually smiled and cried tears of joy. I felt good. The Hillermans were a family again. I actually wanted to be a part of this family again"
15965,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time.."
15966,"almost a great imaginative film. A mixture of shakespeare, pop, jazz, and fairy tales. This movie was an imaginative twist on the Cinderella theme. Everything but production values."
15967,A Dream-like sequence of the classic Fairy Tale with an interesting twist. I would highly suggest this film for anyone who is interested in a dream-like sequence of the classic Fairy Tale with an interesting twist.
15968,"One of the best fairy-tale movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it twice with my teenagers who love it. The best line, ""Your dress is deeply cool!"" says the Prince to Cinderella."
15969,"I thought it was an original story, very nicely told. I mean...it's just a made for television movie! What are you expecting? Some Great dramtic piece? I thought it was a really great story for a made for"
15970,"Creative use of modern and mystical elements. 1956 Cadillac convertible to transport evil stepmother Kathleen Turner (John Waters' ""Serial Mom"") and the 2 twisted sisters."
15971,"Cinderella moves to the early 1950s, but goes over the top at times.<n>The Ugly Sisters have become wildly glamorous upper-class English girls, and Kathleen Turner as the stepmother they flounce about in various wonderful period costumes."
15972,A nostalgic tribute to the underside of New York of the past. Frank Loesser's music sounds great. We watch a magnificent cast of characters that were typical of the underside of the area.
15973,"""Luck Be A Lady Tonight"" and ""Brother...""it's your dice...it's your dice...it's your dice...it's your dice...it's your dice...it's your dice...it"
15974,"Brando, Sinatra, Blaine, Kaye, and Simmons make up the cast of Guys and Dolls......"
15975,"One of my all time favorite musicals and movie musicals! (The other is Damn Yankees with Gwen Verdon, Tab Hunter and Ray Walston) As we all know, sometimes the luster (not to mention the songs) of a show are"
15976,Brando and Simmons bring something else to the party                   
15977,"One of the best films of the 1950's, and one of the best musicals of the 60's, with Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando."
15978,"Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando star in ""Guys And Dolls""<n>Sheldon Leonard adds another page to his rogue's gallery of screen gangsters"
15979,Joseph L. Mankiewicz is one of the finest directors of the 20th century. He brought a fine musical to the screen in such a way that it feels authentic in many scenes but is still a story in its own world.
15980,"I love this movie. My only disappointment was that some of the original songs were changed.brbrVivian Blaine is just excellent in this part and ""Adelaide's Lament"" is my favorite of her songs."
15981,One of the best MGM musicals of the 20th Century - - a must-see for all ages - - even if you're not a Brando fan!
15982,"This movie makes me want to fall in love all over again!I am naming my next daughter ""Adelaide""<n>Just so that someone who sings like Ol Blue eyes can swoon her one day, and feel the butterflies I felt hearing it sung"
15983,"One of the Best Musicals of the 20th Century, but it's not quite as good as it could have been. But it's still great."
15984,"Not as good as I thought it would be, but still a good musical........."
15985,"Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra HATED each other while doing this film and in the years following it.Brando asked Sinatra for some singing lessons,but Sinatra wanted to be the star singer in the production and didn't want any one"
15986,"Guys and Dolls is a great movie, but it's not as good as it could have been. It's not as good as it could have been."
15987,Damon Runyon's genius is still alive and well today                  
15988,"Frank Loesser's ""Guys and Dolls"" is one of the best musicals of the 20th century; a triumph for Loesser and director Mankiewicz"
15989,One of the best movies of all time! A must see for any musical fan! A must see for any fan of Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando!
15990,"Guys and Dolls is a cool 1950s musical, but it's not quite as great as some others of its ilk.<n>Mankiewicz brings a lot of energy to the piece, even when keeping still with the camera on the subject"
15991,One of the best musical movies I've seen in a long time...but not as good as I'd have liked it to be....
15992,"Entertaining musical where Nathan Detroit needs $1,000.00 to get up a floating crap game so he entices Sky Masterson to try and get salvation army girl, played by Jean Simmons"
15993,"One of the best musicals ever made, one of the best musicals ever made, one of the best musicals ever made, one of the best musicals ever made, one of the best musicals ever made, one of the best musicals ever made"
15994,Big splashy film of the Broadway music. Nathan (Frank Sinatra) loves to roll the dice and organize illegal crap games.Vivian Blaine is just wonderful as his long-suffering girlfriend. Her song and dance numbers are definite highlights here.
15995,One of the best musical movies of all time!! Don't waste your money on Rent or Chicago! Don't waste your time on Guys and Dolls!
15996,"Brando at his best, and Simmons at his best, but chemistry is the key to the film's final scene.<n>The most touching, and most serious, scene is between Brando and Blaine"
15997,The story is charming and the acting and songs do not make it any less so. I adore 'I've Never Been In Love Before' and the instrumental version can be heard when Nathan is in Adelaide's dressing room.
15998,"The Greatest Actor in the World in the World's Greatest Musical. Very good! Very good! Frank Sinatra was number 43 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Marlon Brando was number 30 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was"
15999,"The best game I have ever seen in a movie/game remake. I think the developers did a good job. The sniper one I think was too hard, it made me so frustrated I didn't play the game for a week and"
16000,"One of the best third-person shooters I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it's a Bond game."
16001,"One of the best James Bond games ever made, and it's not just because Sean Connery's voice is better than Pierce Brosnan's."
16002,This is the best James bond game i have played in my life it is my favorite James bond game so far because: brbrThe missions in this game are really fun they can be really hard that makes it more fun to
16003,One of the best James Bond games I've ever seen. It's a must have for any James Bond fan. I've played it many times.
16004,"One of the best single-player games I've ever played, and one of the best multi-player games I've ever played! I can't say enough good things about this one!"
16005,"One of the best film noirs of the 60's and 70's with Curtis, Tone, Cook Jr. and Raines in top form."
16006,"One of the most erotic scenes in Hollywood history, despite being at very low budget and made during WWII in black and white. Despite the low budget - Long Island looks somewhat mountainous - this is a movie of original style and outstanding vision"
16007,"This is a film noir that will hook any viewer from the beginning. There are things not explained in it, but it holds the one's interest throughout. The killer is not revealed until the end."
16008,"Siodmak's ""Phantom Lady"" is one of the best B noirs I've ever seen, and it's not just because it stars Raines."
16009,The 'drum/sex scene' separates this film from any others of the same ilk. Clark Richards is the safe fall back choice when one can't decide on having a treat.
16010,One of the best film noirs of the 1940s..but it's not perfect..but it's a great film-flaws aside.
16011,"""La Dama Desconocida"" in Spanish with the original soundtrack ""Ingles"" as an alternative language. I have this film on a ""Suevia Film Noir Cine Negro"" DVD in Spanish as ""La Dama Des"
16012,"A good film with some memorable scenes, but Elisha Cook Jr's performance is not as good as he should have been. I just never like him in anything that I see him in.... someone hand me a neck-tie....."
16013,"One of Robert Siodmak's best noirs, but it's not quite as good as he's made it out to be."
16014,"It's a masterpiece of film making. Not so much because it's a masterpiece of film making, though directed by Curt Siodmak (the credits on IMDb.com read ""Robert"" but the DVD credits list Curt)"
16015,"Le SIECLE DU JAZZ, LE SIECLE DU JAZZ, LE SIECLE DU JAZZ, LE SIECLE DU JAZZ, LE SIECLE DU JAZZ, LE SIECLE DU JAZZ"
16016,"A bizarre and brilliant combination of talents between the director, Robert Siodmak and Ella Raines as a secretary trying to save her boss from the electric chair by tracking down a mysterious ""phantom"" woman, and Franchot Tone as a"
16017,One of the greatest and most under-seen noirs from the era..but it's a little too early..but it's still great!
16018,"""Whew! This WAS a doozy, I must say. Cook deserved some acclaim for his frenzied performance. Cook appeared as a waiter in the 1941 Barbara Stanwyck film, ""Ball of Fire."" He was a waiter in the nightclub"
16019,"This is a ""B Series"" Film Noir, and my vote reflects its membership in that genre. I saw this film last night at a left-bank cinema in Paris, where it opened a two-week film noir run."
16020,"THE NIGHT HAS A THOUSAND EYES, REAR WINDOW, NO MAN OF HER OWN......"
16021,"Drum scene is wild! Cook, Jr. is unsung hero of this and many movies. Fantastic actor, great flick. A few twists that keep you moving"
16022,"One of the major entries in the noir style. As usual with the format, the viewing was far from ideal  marred by the occasional video and (mostly) audio glitches  but, given that the film is still unavailable on R"
16023,A very well-done but dated film noire (for example: everyone smoked like crazy and the police were really stock characters. And no dead bodies were ever shown.) done in the familiar short-scene tableaux format of the period
16024,"Pretty good picture about a man being in the wrong place at the wrong time. If the murderer wanted to whack the dame, why not just off her and let the cops try to figure out whodunnit?"
16025,A fun mystery to unravel. Raines is great as the resourceful woman determined to solve this puzzlement. Thomas Gomez is great as the resourceful woman determined to solve this puzzlement.
16026,"A very good and funny comedy, showing all the rivalry that exists between North/South of Portugal (FC Porto/Benfica) and the North/South of Portugal (FC Porto/Benfica)"
16027,"I felt a great joy, after seeing this film, not because it is a master piece, but because it convinced me, that the Portuguese cinema became really very good."
16028,"""O Lampio da Estrela"" was Diamantino Costa's first movie, before he made several successful commercials. This title is starred by one of the best Portuguese comedians of all times, Herman José and José Pedro"
16029,"True fans of film will love this authentic movie. I disagree with the trolls who are rating this movie a one-star and calling it unrealistic. I don't know what the basis is for others' comments that the film is ""un"
16030,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time. I've seen it a few times, and it's still on my 'favorite movies' list."
16031,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time. brbrI think this film worked for me because I began to watch it with no expectations and found it completely immersing and brought back memories of teenage emotion,"
16032,"""Raising Victor Vargas"" elicits engaging ""debut"" performances from lead actor Victor Rasuk and the cast. Mr. Rasuk and Judy Marte are sexy and endearing as ""Lower East Side Kids"" discovering the joy of sexual"
16033,"An endearing portrait of real people living in poverty in the Lower East Side of New York, or Loisaida, as it's known by the locals. Peter Sollett's heart is in the right place as he examines this dysfunctional"
16034,I'd love to know the backstory behind all this backbiting! :-D                
16035,It's like a cross-section of life with neighborhood kids trying to realize or nurture their honest sexual feelings. It's like a cross-section of life with neighborhood kids trying to realize or nurture their honest sexual feelings.
16036,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time...and I've seen it many times...I'm a Dominican!"
16037,"Wow! I loved this movie and LOVE Judy Marte!! This girl isn't just an awesome pretty face, she's funny and really really..."
16038,One of the best films I have seen in the past five years! The cast is universally spectacular in a tale of young love and bravado on the Lower East Side of New York City with the two leads being superstars in the making
16039,"This movie works because it feels so genuine. The story is simple and realistic, perfectly capturing the joys and anxieties of adolescent love and sexuality that most/all of us experienced during..."
16040,Raising Victor Vargas is a movie you definitely need to see. It was very heart felt and had a lot of humor that gets you sucked right in. It is so much like real life with what teenagers have to go through.
16041,Raising Victor Vargas is so true you will believe it. This flick gets inside your head. I would like to offer a simple review for those who occasionally go to the movies for more...
16042,"One more of those brilliant young men who went all out and dared to make a teen romance film( can i actually call it that?- it would invoke the devil out of its fans)on a micro budget but packed with such taste,"
16043,I'm surprised how many people give this move less than 7 stars.brbrBut they just don't understand the movie.brbrThe story is about growing up in a difficult situation.
16044,This film captures the true struggle with identity that is ongoing in our teenage years. It is really moving and it feels strangely like a documentary-not contrived but very real.
16045,"""Raising Victor Vargas"" is about as close to perfection as a film can get. This simple little slice-of-urban-life ethnic first love flick fleshes out its young characters with such depth you can almost read their minds."
16046,One of the best indie films I've seen in a long time. I loved it. A family who struggles but isn't made into a dysfunctional family which is so typical of films today.
16047,Not as bad as i thought it would be. It has a good cast. Nice to see Roger Moore back on screen as well as the use of other British actors.
16048,"A good film, but it's too short for what it needs to be........"
16049,"This movie was pretty good. The acting was great, and there were some really great actors in it like, Buchholz and Roger Moore. This film is full of surprises. Confusing at times...yes, but the twists and turns of"
16050,One of the best movies i've seen in a long time. Luke Perry did an excellent job once again. I give this movie the highest rating. I give this movie the highest rating.
16051,One of the worst PPVs I've ever seen.. but I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it.
16052,"Wrestlemania 14 is one of the best Wrestlemania's I have ever seen, and one of the best in the history of Wrestlemania's."
16053,One of the greatest Wrestlemania's of all time. One of the greatest matches of all time. One of the greatest matches of all time. One of the greatest matches of all time. One of the greatest matches of all time.
16054,"Worth it for the tag team title match, but not worth it for the Wrestlemania itself......."
16055,"This is the best movie of all times! Sorry, Hollywood! I've seen it in early 70's, as soon as it appeared on the Bulgarian TV, and I loved it immediately (I was 14 then)"
16056,A wonderful portrayal of the cheerful side of Georgian character. This film will make you to burst into laughter and will fill your heart with warm sadness. It will display the overwhelming love of life along with human eccentricities.
16057,"A film to live with. Simple, yet deep, you will want to watch it again and again. A film to live with. Simple, yet deep, you will want to watch it again and again."
16058,"The quintessential Georgian film of Georgi Danelia, Ne goryuy (1969) aka Don't Grieve is loosely based on the novel by French writer Claude Tillier (1801-1844) ""Mon oncle Benjamin"""
16059,this is best comedy i ever seen but not all can understand this you must be from Georgia to understand this movie! :) overall one of best film i ever seen......... Vachtangi(Benjamin) and all supporting actors playing very very very good
16060,"Scooby Doo is a good show, but I wish it were mysteries like 15 episodes. I wish they were mysteries like 15 episodes. Still it is a good show. Still it is a good show."
16061,One of the best episodes of Scooby Doo ever..but not the best series of Scooby Doo..and not the best without Scrappy Doo..but still a good one.
16062,"scrappy was a breath of fresh air to the show.sure,some people tuned out but when scrappy was introduced viewing figures DOUBLED.Back to the show.All the episodes and segments were very funny.i was Intriguded by"
16063,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time. I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once."
16064,"Two Of Us is a fantastic piece of writing and storytelling, and is both informative and touching. For those interested in these two musical giants, very quickly you'll get over the shock of how different the actors look from their counterparts..."
16065,One of the best films ever made about the life and times of John Lennon........

16069,A great film to watch if you're a fan of The Beatles or John Lennon or Paul McCartney......
16070,"One of the few movies about a ""what if"" type of situation that made me think. It was amazing to hear them speak to each other, and reminisce about all the wonderful (and not so wonderful) things that happened between them."
16071,One of the best films I've seen in a long time! I loved it! I can't wait to see the rest of the movie!
16072,A very good way to settle your curiosity on who the beatles really were and what could have happened to them after the break-up. I recommend this film to almost everyone.
16073,"quinn and harris were believable beatle boys, and, as they used to say on t.v., 'i can't believe i watched the whole thing!'"
16074,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and I'll watch it again and again. I'm glad I did!"
16075,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it's about the Beatles. It's about John and Paul."
16076,"Not as good as I thought it would be, but still a good movie for fans of the Beatles.<n>The actors did a very good job in playing John and Paul. The accents could have used maybe a bit more work, but"
16077,"One of the best Columbo episodes, but it's not quite as good as it could have been....."
16078,"Columbo meets his match in Jack Cassidy's murder of his partner in writing. It's not about who does it, it's the familiarness of Columbo and his likability which scores high with viewers like myself."
16079,"One of the most entertaining in the show's history, benefiting tremendously by the work of the late Jack Cassidy and star Peter Falk. Now, both demises are true-life MYSTERIES!"
16080,"""Murder By The Book"" is not as good as ""Publish Or Perish"", but it's still a great episode. But it's not as good as ""Murder By The Book"""
16081,One of the best Columbo episodes ever - and Jack Cassidy's first performance as Ken Frankin is the best in the series. Jack Cassidy is by far the best murderer (having appeared three times) in the Columbo series.
16082,This is the Columbo that got directed by Steven Spielberg at an early point in his career. It's nothing sensational but some small hint of great things to come for Spielberg can be seen in this movie.
16083,Columbo: Murder by the Book (1971) is directed by the young Steven Spielberg before his days of fame.Steven Bochco wrote it.Columbo is a fantastic character with his shabby look.It's hard to believe this man could solve
16084,"""The Gingerbread Man is the first thriller I've ever done!""                 "
16085,"Robert Altman is my favorite American director. I must admit that I have enjoyed the films that are usually scorned: ""Quintet"", if only for..."
16086,"Robert Altman's ""The Gingerbread Man"" is a good adaptation of John Grisham's story.<n>A little clunkier at the end, but not a bad addition to Altman's canon."
16087,"An interesting plot, but the script is weak and the movie doesn't live up to its initial promise....."
16088,"One of Altman's best, but he's not quite as good as he used to be.<n>Torn, in the end I judged it a 7."
16089,"Daryl Hannah does a great job as a woman tired of Lois, but used to, covering up for her boss' indiscretions. She doesn't have a huge role but she does a great job portraying Harlan as a woman tired of"
16090,"A great suspense thriller, with a great cast and a great plot. I don't understand the low 5.7 rating on this film. It's a delight for people who like a strong suspense plot and dark atmospherics."
16091,One of the best in this viewer's (limited) viewing history. One of the best in this viewer's (limited) viewing history. One of the best in this viewer's (limited) viewing history.
16092,It's just a good flick!! I was pleasantly surprised at just how good it was. Even the acting was fairly decent. The plot was more solid than most adult films I've seen.
16093,Cameron Grant at the top of his form in DINNER PARTY!!                
16094,The Dinner Party is one of the best adult films I've seen in a long time. It's a must see for all adult film fans.
16095,Cameron Grant is one of the best directors doing adult films. Celeste is dynamite all thru the movie but the DR's office sequence with her & two other ladies is just incredible. Nearly as good is Asia Carrera's performance with the construction
16096,"""Who Loves The Sun"" works its way through some prickly subject matter with enough wit and grace to keep the story not only engaging, but often hilarious."
16097,the best film i saw at the L.A. film festival this year. i'm a big fan of molly parker and Lukas haas!
16098,"""Who Loves the Sun"" is a perfect leisurely pastime of a story, why ever not. You get to hang out with the trio: Lukas Haas is Will (returning after abruptly leaving everyone years ago), Molly Parker is Maggie (we"

16100,"Paris je t'aime is the best of the Coens, Tykwer, Van Sant, Cohens, Coixet and Dépardieu"
16101,One of the best movies I've seen in a very long time - but it's not as good as I'd like it to be!
16102,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, but it's not the best of them all......"
16103,One of the best episodes I've seen in a long time! The best movie I've seen in a long time! The best movie I've seen in a long time!
16104,The whole does not even come close to the sum of the parts. No problem. This film features a line-up of some of the most diversely creative directors of our time and some really famous names in the cast.
16105,Paris je t'aime is a wonderful collection of short films about love and life in the city of love. A must see for all those who love Paris.
16106,"A good study of how to make a 5 min film..and sometimes, what doesn't work (if it covers too much time, emotionally, for a short film.)"
16107,"Delightful film directed by some of the best directors in the industry today. The film is also casting some of the great actors of our time, not just from France but from everywhere."
16108,"A very unusual format that takes a couple of segments to adjust to as a viewer. We are so accustomed to character development over a 2 hour movie, it is a bit disarming for that to occur in an 8 minute segment."
16109,One of the best films I've seen in a long time..........

16111,"""Paris Je T'Aime"" is a collection of short films, often sketches from 18 talented directors from all over the world. In each, we become familiar with one of the City of Light 20 arrondissements and with the Parisians"
16112,"""Paris, t'Aime"" is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It's a mosaic of love stories."
16113,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, even if it's just a collection of short stories. I'll give it 5 stars."
16114,"Paris Je T'Aime is a movie that explores the different kinds and aspects of love and all the emotions that it provokes. In conclusion, this movie is a compilation of stories of happiness, separation, unexpected encounters and love."
16115,"Paris, je t'aime (2006) is a film made up of 18 segments. You can do the math--18 segments in 120 minutes. The movie is based on the premise that you can, indeed, tell a story in that short"
16116,"Not enough of the ""light"" and beauty of Paris-- not enough of the romance, too much darkness, not enough of the ""plots"""
16117,it's a very nice movie and i would definitely recommend it to everyone. but there are 2 minus points: - the level of the stories has a large spectrum.
16118,"Paris, je t'aime is a collection of 20 short films (about 5 mins each) by 20 directors showing love in various pockets of contemporary Paris"
16119,One of the most interesting films I've seen in a long time - and I'm not just saying that because I'm a cynic myself.
16120,"Paris, JE T'AIME is a wondrous cinematic homage to the city of light and the city of love, a film so complex that it almost defies summarization and reviewing"
16121,"Paris, JE T'AIME is a collection of 18 short films by a variety of international directors. Each piece is named after a different Parisian neighborhood and is a reflection on love."
16122,Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful!
16123,An excellent film that is both hilarious and tragic at the same time. The script is flawless and the performances are top notch. This is a must-see for any budding filmmaker and anyone with a serious interest in the craft of film-making
16124,"""Hollywood North"" is an euphemism from the movie industry as they went to Canada to make movies because of tax breaks and cheaper costs in a civilized city like Toronto, in this case, later in Vancouver."
16125,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time - and I'm not just saying that because it's on DVD. I'm about to study film-making in Canada.
16126,"""Hollywood North"" captures the essence of an overbearing American patriot actor -- one that believes his work (and politics) are as crucial to the American people as the opinions of the President himself. Alan Bates captures this mindset perfectly as Michael Baytes"
16127,Low budget meets lower budget with High laugh content. Low budget meets lower budget with High laugh content. I recently saw this film and enjoyed it very much. It gives a insight to indie movie making and how much work is really involved when you
16128,A satirical look at the time in Canadian film history when the Canadian government offered huge tax breaks for films made in Canada. Most of the time it was treated as a tax shelter or a cheap way to get American films made.
16129,"The new Doctor Who is just as good as the old one, and Piper's performance is the real triumph of this ""reboot"" of the classic sci-fi series"
16130,The Doctor's return to our screens! And they did it! And they did it with style! And they did it with style! And they did it with style! And they did it with style! And they did it with style
16131,The Doctor is back - and back with a bang! Ten million people tuned in to see the new Doctor. What is more important is how good a script this is.
16132,"The last film from Vittorio de Sica and Cesare Zavattini, a neorealist fantasy, very funny, very strange, and very enjoyable."
16133,"This is a really strange film--and that is NOT a bad thing. I'm sure that some may find this movie a bit too strange, but I loved it."
16134,De Sica speaks in a very direct way. His Italianness doesn't have the convoluted self examination of modern Italian filmmakers. De Sica told us the stories like a father sitting at the edge of his children's bed before they
16135,"An allegory for all the homeless people that populated Europe after the great war. They are homeless but cheerful, in a societies too impoverished and selfish to care for or acknowledge them, footmats for the Italian carpetbaggers."
16136,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
16137,"One of the most inspiring, uplifting movies ever made. It is a monument to the best qualities of the human spirit, as well as to the endless creative resources of that land of inspiration."
16138,"Very sentimental, and funny, but not a masterpiece like Umberto D or The Bicycle Thief. But it is a lovable and hilarious comedy, with good music."
16139,If you have trouble suspending disbelief then this isn't for you. Consider: a woman already in late middle age finds a newborn baby in a cabbage patch and raises it as...
16140,"De Sica is becoming one of my favorite directors, but this one was a hit-and-miss for me. The coupling of neorealism and fantasy comes out more as an experiment of the ""look-what-we-can"
16141,"This is an action packed but sensitive movie about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting. Well-acted, even by Elizabeth Berkley. Recommended for anyone who wants to feel something and experience change."
16142,"Boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring,"
16143,"""Pandora's Clock"" is an intelligent political thriller that is far beyond the quality of most TV movies. It could just as easily have made its debut on the big screen."
16144,"Pandora's Clock is one of the best thrillers you will ever read. A highly faithful adaptation of John J. Nance's novel,which had a frightfully real scenario in the novel,is made even more so here."
16145,"I finally got to watch ""Pandora's Clock"" again after eight years, and it was just as exciting and tense as when I first saw it."
16146,One of the best TV movies I've seen in a long time. Richard Dean Anderson's performance is outstanding. A pleasant surprise to see Daphne Zuniga after quite a long time dating back to The Fly II.
16147,"""Pandora's Clock"" is a gripping suspense/thriller that's a cross between a virus movie and a disaster film.""Pandora's Clock"" is a gripping suspense/thriller that's a cross between a virus movie"
16148,"A nice, old-fashioned sports film with a real-life story. Quaid is great as a high school coach and a Major League pitcher in this one."
16149,"""The Rookie"" is a great movie, but it's not quite as good as the book or the documentary on Jim Morris, but it's still good."
16150,"A fine story about following your dreams and actually taking a stab at Doing something about them when the chance strikes. I am glad that they showed his indecision, almost up 'til he got the callup to the majors."
16151,The Rookie is a great movie about one man's quest to reach his dream. Dennis Quaid makes it worth while. It's a great underdog story.
16152,"""It all started with a mouse...and it ended with baseball."" (sobs) ""It all started with a mouse...and it ended with baseball."" (sobs)"
16153,"A wonderful, inspirational, feel good movie that is intelligently written and believably acted by everyone concerned. It resists going for every sentimental trick in the book, as well as all of the other clichés."
16154,"A ""feel good"" story with a ""feel good"" cast. Dennis Quaid is on-target here, and he's on-target here."
16155,One of my favorite sports movies. Dennis Quaid is moving and convincing in the part of a man who gave up his dream of being a baseball pitcher when his arm gave out on him.
16156,Living dreams with the family is what this one is about. I think only a father who has a close relationship with his family can truly appreciate what Jimmy Morris did.
16157,"""The Rookie"" hits a home run with this G-rated, feel-good, four-bagger of a baseball epic.<n>Like the foul-mouthed ""Bad News Bears,"" ""The Rookie"" chronicles Jim's triumph at"
16158,One of the best baseball movies I've seen in a long time.........
16159,"This is a feel good film, about one person's dreams and the drive or push to realize them. It is a beautiful and inspirational film. Why do some people have to try and find fault with every film that comes out, especially"
16160,"a great family film.Dennis Quaid is sensational as the title character.it's a great movie for the whole family.it's inspirational,but doesn't pour it on too thick.it's fun and entertaining."
16161,"A very fine baseball tribute film, and a nice lesson about pursuing your dreams. Dennis Quaid does a masterful job with his role, and I was touched by his performance. Definitely worth a full price ticket and a couple hours of your time"
16162,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Dennis Quaid pulls it off very well. I was impressed that I could take my 5 year old son to this movie without having to cover his ears or eyes.
16163,"One of the best sports films I have seen since Any Given Sunday. Dennis Quaid is absolutely perfect as the science teacher turned baseball player Jimmy Morris. As a sports film, The Rookie is one of the best I have seen since Any Given"
16164,This movie could have been much better if it wasn't so bogged down in key places..<n>Dennis Quaid does a fairly decent job in his role... but something is clearly missing from several key scenes.
16165,"A great baseball movie, but a little too much ""Disney"" for my taste. Dennis Quaid had all of the right moves and stances of a major league pitcher."
16166,'The Rookie' is the movie for you!! It's the feel good movie of the year and it is the perfect movie for all ages. 'The Rookie' hits a major home run!
16167,A nice movie for a family to enjoy. And the organization of information was just thrown at you which was something I didn't like either but in all it was a good movie.
16168,"What a fun movie experience! I was expecting a sappy kids movie and found that I enjoyed it more than my teens. Take a tissue, it's not sad, just'moving' in parts. Finally, its a 'feel good"
16169,A True Story of a High School Baseball Coach and His Dream to Play in the Majors.......
16170,"If you like baseball heart-warmers, you'll love this film. The ingredients for Americana and apple pie were all in there. My popcorn became the a la mode'"
16171,The Rookie keeps me smiling from beginning to end. Dennis Quaid played the role to perfection. The little boy that plays his son was fantastic. He made this a father-son movie to remember.
16172,"Another great sports story based on truth. It's a great feel good type movie. We were not let down, when asked if we'd be buying this on DVD when it comes out, it was a no-brainer."
16173,"A movie for people who are coming to terms with life's inevitable twists and turns.<n>Dennis Quaid makes it look good, Rachel Griffiths makes it look good, and the camera-work is slow and sweet"
16174,"This is a movie that plays to everyone's emotions. We all want a second chance at things. Jim Morris got one, followed his heart and got a chance to live his dream"
16175,One of the best sports movies I've seen in a long time! :C) [not that anyone's going to believe that...]
16176,This movie is surprisingly good. I predict that it will do surprising business as it is a G-rated movie that doesn't require the viewer to stop thinking.
16177,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
16178,"""Girlfight"" is not about boxing, it's about the film. So much so you can almost smell the sweat. Technically and artistically a good shoot with a sense of honesty and reality about it, ""Girlfight"" is no"

16182,"A gritty, non-Hollywood look at the inner workings of a girl's life in the boxing ring. A must see for any boxing fan."
16183,"A ""gender-blind"" athletic program that makes no distinctions between males and females, a misguided attempt to level the athletic playing field. Without it, there might not be any humans at all."
16184,"Michelle's best performance in a long time, she's a fighter, she's a warrior, she's a fighter, she's a warrior, she's a fighter, she's a warrior, she'"
16185,Girlfight is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it a million times. I've seen it over and over.
16186,This is a great film for those who like to see a sexy girl in the boxing ring. Michelle Rodriquez is a great actress..and Diana Guzman is a great character.
16187,Girlfight is one of the best sports movies I've seen in a long time.......
16188,"Well acted, well scripted story about a young woman who almost accidentally gets into female boxing. She is responsible for taking her younger brother to his practice sessions and get interested while observing his bouts."
16189,I really enjoyed Girl Fight. It something I could watch over and over again. The acting was Fantastic and i thought Michelle Rodriguez did a good job in the film.
16190,girlfight is one of the best movies i've seen in a long time. it makes you feel like you're in the middle of it.
16191,"I Think It's a great movie. because you get to see how Diana's life at home is. she got so much aggression, and she wants to prove that girls can fight too."
16192,"More of a coming-of-age-story than it is a fight flick. And what a relief to have one in an urban school, with naturalistic, realistic Latinos and believable use of Brooklyn project settings."
16193,"It's not a ""Rocky with girls"" movie, it's a ""Girlfight"" movie, and Michelle Rodriguez is very good in the lead."
16194,"Michelle Rodriguez is the defining actress of her generation, and this film shows her in a rarely seen tough-girl role....."
16195,"It's not so bad, but the last half hour is a bit dull. I gave it a 7 out of 10, merely because of the dull last half hour."
16196,The first 3/4's of this movie are truly remarkable. I gave it an 8. I gave it an 8. There are some remarkable performances here. Check out this movie
16197,One of the best boxing movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more times than I've seen this movie..

16199,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of Michelle Rodriguez's best as well......"
16200,One of the best movies i have ever seen. Michelle Rodriguez is the best actress i have seen in a long time. This movie deserves the grand jury prize at sundance.
16201,"This movie shows that you can do anything if you have the potential to do it, even if you don't think you have the potential to do it."
16202,Michelle Rodriguez and Santiago Douglas are excellent in this boxing movie..........
16203,One of the best chick flicks I've seen in a long time. A must see for any girl who wants to take her dreams to the next level.
16204,A true fighter in life and a must see for anyone who loves boxing. Michelle Rodriguez is amazing. I'm amazed that this is the first time she's been up for an indie film.
16205,I thought this movie was good. I gave it a 8/10. That's how good it is. Plus a movie with Michelle Rodriguez is always good. Even is she's been in only six
16206,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time,and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time,and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
16207,One of the best movies about rape I've ever seen. I think it should have been in theaters. It's very realistic. I enjoyed it very much.
16208,"This is a great film, but the ending is a little disappointing. I would have loved it to turn out a little different. Never mind though, good gripping story."
16209,"She Fought Alone is one of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time."
16210,"Excellent story about teenagers, leaders, high school football ""stars"". How far will you go to protect your friends? Lie, kill? How much can You lose if you stud by an innocent girl? Can love beat the odds? Can love"

16212,"Not Verhoeven's best work, but at least it's better than some of his other films.. Jereone Krabbe is amazing as the ""tortured artist"", and the supporters were very good as well"
16213,"Verhoeven's ""The Fourth Man"" isn't quite as good as he'd like it to be, but it's still good."
16214,"One of the best films of the 1940's, if you don't know what you're talking about. A.I. Bezzerides' original script made this relationship explicit."
16215,"hypnothised by the visual quality and the fascinating mysteriosity. Maybe you can say that I didn't quite 'get' the film, but I have been watching like hypnothised for 1.5 hour"

16218,"It was a lot of fun rooting for Hop-a-long Cassidy. It was a great tribute to the Western serials of years ago. It wasn't meant to be a great cinema experience, except..."
16219,"An interesting update of the classic programmers of the thirties and forties. Though guilty of some bad acting, this is earnest enough and unpretentious, making it hard for me to dislike."
16220,"A Good Adaptation of the Novels of Clarence Mulford's ""Cassidy""<n>A Good Movie, But Some Critics Have Missed the Point.."
16221,"""Haunted Summer"" is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time......"

16332,"A good story, told in a compelling way. The handheld camera approach to action scenes added to the intensity of those scenes. Joel Schumacher shows he doesn't need a big budget to produce a gripping film."
16333,This was a good movie. It wasn't your typical war flick but something a bit different. This movie showed us recruits in training before the war and not actually fighting a war.

16406,One of the best stand-ups I've seen in a very long time! Eddie's the best comic I've seen in a long time!
16407,"I laughed so hard I'm sure I missed half the jokes. This showcases Izzard as the brilliantly gifted comedian he is. What I particularly like is that he seems never to be ""dumbing down"" the material for his audience."
16408,This is another gem of a stand up show from Eddie Izzard. You cannot fail to laugh at the wide range of topics he talks about. He even takes the piss out of his American audiance at times and most of...
16409,Hilarious hardly begins to describe this one of a kind genuine tour-de-Star-Wars-force (Luke: how strong? Vader: the strength of a small pony)
16410,One of Eddie's best..and one of his best..and one of his best..and one of his best..and one of his best..and one of his best..and one of his best
16411,"Eddie Izzard's ""Aristocrats"" isn't the best, but it's better than ""Aristocrats"""
16412,"In the backdrop of this performance, one of the images is George Serat's ""A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte"" painting (seen best in chapter 18)"
16413,"I wish I could laugh again as much as when I saw this show for the first time. I have not done so ever since. I find myself laughing almost as hard after watching the show again, and again."
16414,"What more could anyone want? He's a history lesson, foreign language tutor, NRA representative and ambassador to Burundi dressed in a nice silk frock and heels"
16415,"If you can't laugh at yourself, never watch this. Also, if you can't laugh at yourself, never watch this. Also, I've watched his other stuff and even saw him perform live, and this is by"
16416,"One of the best comedians ever. I've seen this show about 10 times and will probably watch it at least 100 more. My friends and family quote from this DVD so often, you'd think we did nothing..."
16417,This is an excellent stand-up DVD! Eddie Izzard is the funniest person I have seen in years. His routine is hilarious and makes for great conversation with others who have seen it.
16418,"""Dress to Kill"" is one of Eddie Izzard's best standup comedy performances. He's one of the funniest comedians I've ever seen."
16419,"One of the best stand-up shows evre. EVER. Eddie is so off the wall that I've been watching this damn show for nearly five years now, and it still rocks every single time."
16420,Eddie is Glorious in this performance from San Francisco. I don't remember laughing so hard at a stand up routine. My wife and I both enjoyed this tape and his work on Glorious I just wish I could buy a copy and help support
16421,I could listen all day. His unique approach to life is quite logical. His understanding of discovery (such as the Heimlich Maneuver) is creative.
16422,"""Dress to Kill"" - Eddie Englebert's best stand-up performance to date..............."
16423,Izzard was hysterical and insightful in his humor. He definitely represents his own little niche in the comedic world.brbrIt's a pity more Americans won't see this stand-up routine due to its PAL-only
16424,Eddie Izzard is one of the funniest comedians I have ever seen. He is one of the funniest comedians I have ever seen. I could not stop laughing for the entire show.

16426,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once."
16427,One of the best movies I've seen this year and I'm looking forward to his next one. And I'd have to say it's one of the best movies I've seen this year and I'm greatly
16428,"A typical Clausen film, but then again not typical. Clausen writes, directs and play one of the leading roles. This is really a great film about normal people living normal lives trying to make the best of it."

16434,"This movie is light, funny, and beautifully filmed. The lightning is absolutely superb, and the colours convincingly remind Vermeer paintings.brbrThis is sentimental comedy at its best, way above US and French standards, and arguably better than"
16435,"A small movie moment that will be recognized as a marking movie of year 2004 for the Quebec. The actors Isabelle Blais, Emmanuel Bilodeau, Sylvie Moreau and Stéphane Gagnon all deliver a touching performance."
16436,"A must-see film for people who want to learn the technical craft of acting, and for people who appreciate Yiddish films and character studies. Summer Phoenix's characterless portrayal conveys Kahn's mental and physical hebe"

16440,"Summer Phoenix does a great performance where you really feel what she's not able to feel and you just cannot understand what she has on her mind. Besides, she portrays a jewish girl who behaves really confronting the status quo of that century"
16441,"""Stories Of The Century"" was the first to win an Emmy Award for best syndicated series. It was the very first show to come from the fabled studios of Republic Pictures, known for its low-budget but high-powered shoot-em"

16443,"Jim Davis at his best as Matt Clark, the railroad detective of the 1800's and 30's.<n>The best of the western up and comers, Slim Pickins as Butch Cassady and ""The Smilin' Kid"""
16444,"An interesting series that takes real life people (Jesse James, John Wesley Hardin, etc.)...and dramatizes part of their real story with a continuing series character taking part in that story."
16445,"This is a wonderful film with an excellent moral to the story. I would prefer this movie to many ""A"" rate movies I have seen even a great number with high box office earnings.brbrI highly recommend this movie"
16446,My Grandmother loved it sooo much that i bought her the DVD and recommended it to her friends. It will bring tears to your eyes and warmth to your heart as you see the white Tony Donato and African American Nathan Davis bond.
16447,One of the funniest films I've seen in a long time...and it's all a comedy!!!!!...and it's all a comedy!!!!!
16448,De Vierde Man (The Fourth Man) is one of the most compelling thrillers I have ever seen. It really was a pleasant surprise. The story concerns bi-sexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe)
16449,"Very erotic, original and blasphemous, not for kids or people that go to church every Sunday. Great cinematography by future director Jan de Bont."
16450,"A stylish neo-noir thriller from Paul Verhoeven's first film, but it's not quite as good as he's made it..."
16451,"""De vierde man"" (The Fourth Man, 1984) is considered one of the best European pycho thrillers of the eighties. It takes much time to create a dark and gripping atmosphere, and a few moments of extreme graphic violence have"
16452,"""The Vierde Man"" is another magnificent feature of Paul Verhoeven in his Dutch phase. The story is supported by an excellent screenplay that uses Catholic symbols to build the tension associated to smart dialogs"
16453,"""De Vierde Man"" is Verhoeven's best erotic thriller to date - and it's not even close to ""Showgirls"" or ""Basic Instinct"""
16454,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time. It's a masterpiece of a movie. I don't know if I'd consider it a masterpiece of not, but it's damn near close"
16455,De VIERDE MAN (aka THE FOURTH MAN) is a slightly unsettling and rather fascinating experience. It's a very tight and intense psychological mystery/thriller from Netherlands's Paul Verhoeven.
16456,One of Paul Verhoeven's strangest and most satisfying films to date........
16457,"Paul Verhoeven's last Dutch language film, a psychological drama that ""stuck"" in my memory. I saw it in 1983 and it is a film that ""stuck"""
16458,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more than once, and I've seen it more than once."
16459,"One of Verhoeven's best, but it's not quite as good as ""Starship Troopers"" or ""The Last Picture Show"""
16460,"One of Verhoeven's best, but also one of his most controversial........"
16461,"""The Fourth Man"" is a brilliant pscychosexual drama which is a lit bit complex for some audiences.it is really a wonderful thriller i enjoyed very much."
16462,"erotic thriller with many graphic and ""blasphemous"" scenes that will undoubtedly disturb some viewers. However, it'll be hard even for them not to appreciate the several imaginative sequences this film contains"
16463,"One of Paul Verhoeven's best films, but it's not just about blood and sex. It's about a man haunted by visions."
16464,"I'm a freeloader, living off of society. Get a grip! This guy is a freeloader, living off of society. I suspect that the real reason he is having these fantasy-nightmares about the ""spiderwoman"
16465,"The 4th Man is one of Verhoeven's best, and most disturbing movies......."
16466,One of the best femme fatale films ever made..and one of the worst..and one of the worst..and one of the worst..and one of the worst..and one of the worst..and
16467,One of the best Dutch films I have ever seen. Jerome Crabbe is great in this movie. I wish Jerry Goldsmith never died. Dutch films are different but still enjoyable. Dutch films are different but still enjoyable.
16468,"""La Bte"" (aka ""The Beast"" or ""O Monstro"")only can be done in the old continent :),in this film we see all: horses dirty sex, nymphomaniac kind off gorilla, non sense"
16469,"One of the most bizarre films I've seen in a long time, and it's not Disney's 'Beauty & The Beast' or Jean Cocteau's 'Beauty & The Beast'"
16470,"""La bte"" is a fascinating blend of intense and beautiful fairy-tale-like atmosphere, quite explicit eroticism and genuine weirdness."
16471,"Good movie, very 70s, you can not expect much from a film like this, Sirpa Lane is an actress of erotic films, a nice body but nothing exceptional savant to a pornographic actress from the body disappears"
16472,One of the funniest films I've seen in a long time - and it's not just because it's an adaptation of a book..
16473,"This movie is simply incredible! I had expected something quite different form the film that I actually saw. However, it is very insightful in that it shows the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its linkage with animal behavior"
16474,"erotic schlock Gothic horror that will be loved by Hammer House of Horror fans the world over. Appears to be an interesting take on ""Beauty and the Beast"""
16475,a good film that is well acted and serves a purpose...to shock the viewer and cross boundaries that we don't see to often in films. I came across this film on the net that I thought I might check out.
16476,I thought I had seen it all. But there you go. I had no idea I could ever find (ick) the idea of beastiality erotic. Never never never. Ever. Ever. But there you go.
16477,Well...well...well...well...well...well...well...well...well...well...well...well...well...well...well...well...well...well...well...well...well...well...well...well...
16478,"I'd say that indeed this movie does speak to the viewer on a deeper level concerning bestial carnality. Once I have learned this, the story became much more interesting beyond the giddiness of shock value and there fore"
16479,"I guess this is meant to be a sort of reworking or updating of ""Beauty and the Beast"", but I can't say I've ever watched a movie that began with several minutes of graphic horse sex"
16480,"This is a film exploring the female sexuality in a way not so often used. Almost every other film with this kind of sexual scenes always becomes rated X, and so seen as a pornographic movie."
16481,"One of the best films of all time, and one of the best movies of all time for adults and children alike. Miyazaki's Laputa is an adventure of a grand scale."
16482,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time!"
16483,"One of the best animated family films of all time, and one of the best by Hiyao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli. Highly recommended for people aged 6 to 60!"
16484,"One of the best animated films I've ever seen, but Disney has spoiled it with intrusive music and voice-acting changes......."
16485,"One of my all time favorite movies, PERIOD. I can't think of another movie that combines so many nice movie qualities like this one does."
16486,"One of my top 10 films of all time. Buy it or rent it just see it, best viewing is at night alone with drink and food in reach so you don't have to stop the film."
16487,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time. And I urge everyone to see it. I think it's one of Miyazaki's best films with a powerful lesson tuckered inside this two hour and four"
16488,One of the best movies ever made by a master of animation! I've seen it many times and i've never seen it better than this!
16489,"One of the greatest animated films of all time, and it's the only one available in the U.S. in its original English language dub."
16490,"One of the best films I've ever seen, and one of the best movies I've ever seen in my entire life. I've fallen in love with the two of them more than I have with any other Miyazaki couple."
16491,Hayao Miyazaki's first film - a must-have for any fan of the Japanese anime genre.......
16492,A film that will enchant and entertain adults and children alike..........
16493,Castle in the Sky is one of the best animes I've ever seen........
16494,"One of the greatest films of all time, and one of the best in the history of animation. I can't believe I've only seen it twice."
16495,"the best anime cartoon of all time, i've seen it many times and still can't believe i've seen it again. i can't believe i've seen it again."
16496,"Hayao Miyazaki's second feature film, and his first one to be widely acclaimed both commercially and critically (though his debut - Nausicaa AKA Warriors of the Wind is considered by many fans his best)"
16497,"It's a crime that it took this long to be released in the U.S., but now that it's here check it out!"
16498,Disney's choice of voice actors looks very promising. The story is about a young boy who meets a girl with a history that is intertwined with his own. The two are thrown into one of the most fun and intriguing storylines in any animated
16499,One of the best movies I've ever seen...........
16500,Hayao Miyazaki at his best in Castle in the Sky! br                
16501,I've never seen a film like this before. I'm a Miyazaki fan. I've never seen a film like this. I've never seen a film like this. I've never seen a film like this.
16502,"This is the best dub I've ever heard by Disney, as well as the best adaptation since the biggest abuse ever on soundtrack, themes, characters, dialogues in Kiki Delivery Service"
16503,One of the best animes I've ever seen! But the English dubbed version is not too good. Perhaps the 1999 version will be better. It is an almost ideal romantic anime! MUST SEE FOR ALL AGES!
16504,"Not as good as Nausicaa, but not as bad as Nausicaa, but still not as good as Nausicaa, but not as good as Nausicaa"
16505,"One of Hayao Miyazaki's best films, and a must-see for fans of his other works.<n>Miyazaki's musical score is the star of the new dub."
16506,"""Castle in the Sky"" is not as good as ""Spirited Away,"" but still pretty good. James Van Der Beek fares best. Anna Paquin is nearly as good as Sheeta."
16507,"The floating island of this tale is taken from the classic Jonathan Swift novel ""Gulliver's travels"", which was published in the early to mid 1700s."
16508,"One of the best films I have ever seen, but it's ruined by Disney's re-dubbed version of the film. It's a shame that Disney bought the Studio Ghibli back-catalogue and then proceeded to butcher"
16509,"The first time I ever saw this movie was back in the 1980s as a wee lad. My dad actually recorded it off the TV. I must have watched is over 20 times, before the..."
16510,"I remember liking this more than Nausicaa of the valley of the winds at an age when that tone of story was too serious for me. Laputa, whose title seems to have affected its release in the U.S. to avoid"
16511,One of the best films I've seen in a long time - and it's not just because it's a film about the French Revolution!
16512,"""The Lady and the Duke"" could have used a better translation for the title. ""The English Woman and the Duke"", perhaps, would have been more accurate."
16513,This film is riveting and doesn't have a boring moment. Why? Because it is comprised largely of intelligent dialogue between real people in a moment of crisis and details their efforts to survive that crisis.
16514,"Erich Rohmer's ""L'Anglaise et le duc"" makes a perfect companion piece to Peter Watkins' ""La Commune (Paris 1871)"""
16515,"""La Anglaise..."" (from the story itself) is the fabulous aesthetics that Rohmer has achieved. The images have been digitally decorated too make them look like baroque pictures."
16516,"I was particularly moved by the understated courage and integrity of l'Anglaise, in this beautifully acted, intellectually and visually compelling film. Thank you so much, Monsieur le directeur Rohmer"
16517,"One of Rohmer's better films, but it's not a great movie. It's not a great movie, but it's a good movie."
16518,"One of the best ""video game/comic book"" movies i've seen in a long time. I'm so glad i got a chance to see it."
16519,"Well-thought-out, well-paced, well-paced, well-thought-out, well-thought-out, well-thought-out, well-thought-out, well-thought-out, well-thought-"
16520,A very entertaining SCI-FI movie from Japan. I have noticed a lot of disappointed film geeks who loved Versus this director's debut film or his third film Azumi.
16521,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
16522,"I liked the build up, it was intriguing to me. Now if the payoff was half as good as the build up was I would have rated this so much higher."
16523,"An inventive, exercise in claustrophobia. A Japanese thriller that sets itself a tough challenge by being entirely set in two rooms. Not completely successful, but taut, surprising and well-acted."
16524,It's not Versus! It's Alive! It's Alive! It's Alive! It's Alive! It's Alive! It's Alive! It's Alive! It's Alive!
16525,The only film that captures on film the uncapturable world of the American college experience of the late 60s-early 70s. Why isn't this film available from imdb?
16526,"Jack Nicholson's directorial debut, Drive, He Said contains vivid, interesting characterizations.<n>The film tells of two college kids: the protagonist is Hector (William Tepper, in what borders on a break-out performance)"
16527,"Good luck finding this film to even watch - it's not yet released on tape or DVD. I saw on release in the early '70's, was lucky enough to catch it via American Cinematheque's preservation efforts"
16528,Pinjar is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once.
16529,"Pinjar is a genuinely good film, with great acting, good narrative, good presentation, touching emotions, etc.<n>A must-see film. A technically superior Bollywood product, which I feel is comparable to the best movies coming out of"
16530,"Pinjar is an excellent film for those seeking a change from the normal equation based Bollywood film. Set during the time of Partition between India and Pakistan, Pinjar focuses on a Punjabi girl who becomes the victim of societal and cultural attitudes toward the"
16531,"One of the few movies that really leaves a mark and makes you think hard. Set in Partition India, this film Shows the true reality of partition India. Urmila gets full marks for her beautiful and deeply emotional portrayal of a suffering woman with"
16532,One of the best movies I've ever seen. I've never seen one like this before. I've been a Hindi buff since the age of 4.
16533,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.........
16534,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
16535,"If you only see one Bollywood film in your life, make it Pinjar. For strength of nuance alone I cannot recommend this film highly enough. For Urmila Matondkar's portrayal of Puro, she breathes life into the character"
16536,A very good adaptation of the novel by amrita pritam. Urmila and manoj bajpai have given their best. There is a natural flair in the movie and i felt it right through.
16537,Pinjar is truly a masterpiece..... It's a thought provoking Film that makes you think and makes you question our culture. It is without a doubt the best Hindi movie I have seen to date.
16538,One of the best films I've seen in a long time.<n>One of the best films I've seen in a long time.
16539,One of the better movies about the partition that I have seen. Urmila Matondkar is gorgeous too. This is one of the most personal and down-to-earth films I've seen on the partition
16540,"A very well-made film, but it's hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented.<n>The message is that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and both can be"
16541,One of Dr Dwivedi's best movies. A must-see for all Panjab fans. A must-see for those who have not seen Panjab.
16542,"A complex story laid on the background of partition of Bharat. An honest Muslim who kidnaps an innocent Hindu girl, and an educated Hindu who burns the harvest of a Muslim man - yet in the end you end up liking them both."
16543,Pinjar by Mr dwivedi is one of the greaest and finest of 2003......
16544,"Snoop does a good job as a writer, and Dylan McDermott does a good job as a writer too......"
16545,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, but it's not quite as good as the novel it's based on."
16546,One of the best spaghetti westerns I've seen in a long time.........
16547,One of the best Spaghetti Westerns I've ever seen..and one of the best endings of any film I've ever seen..!
16548,"One of the more satisfying Western all'Italian all'timera. Johnny Yuma has the freshness of many WAI made during the heyday of the genre and is highly recommended for fans of the genre or offbeat, intelligent cinema."
16549,"One of the first times I saw a really wicked woman on film, who pretends to be anything but wicked - can't be compared with the witch in 'Snowwhite'"
16550,"""Johnny Yuma"" is probably one of the best of the genre that doesn't have Clint Eastwood in it. Mark Damon is a reasonably suitable stand in but without the seething exterior."
16551,"Good production values, a likable performance by Mark Damon, and a breezy action packed script combine to make this an entertaining, if not exceptionally deep, above average addition to the spaghetti western genre"
16552,One of the best animated Superman series I've ever seen. brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
16553,"One of the very best depictions of Superman on TV, as well as one of the most faithful to a particular comics period. It deserves to be released on DVD/Blu-ray!"
16554,"""The Mother"" is a provocative look at a scarcely filmed reality - a woman who isn't ready to stay home, watch ""the telly,"" and vegetate after her husband of nearly three decades"
16555,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time........"
16556,"One of the best British films of the year, and one of the best of Hanif Kureishi's since ""My Beautiful Laundrette"""
16557,"""Why not?"" ""Why not?"" Why not? Why not?"" Why not? Why not? Why not? Why not? Why not? Why not? Why not? Why not? Why not? Why not? Why not? Why"
16558,"I'm so glad this is a British film because Hollywood never would have done it, and even if they had, they would have ruined it by not taking the time to develop the characters."
16559,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time - and one of the best I've seen in a long, long time"
16560,A brilliant performance by Anne Reid as a woman on the verge of falling for her son's handy man.....
16561,May's awakening into a world she doesn't even know it existed until now.brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
16562,"An excellent film dealing with a potentially exploitative subject with great sensitivity. Anne Reid, previously best known in the UK for her TV roles including 'Dinnerladies'"
16563,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time........."
16564,"""The Mother"" is one of my all-time favorite films. It is simply one of my all-time favorite films. It is simply one of my all-time favorite films."
16565,"A must see for serious film lovers. A must see for serious film lovers. A real triumph for Roger Michell and Hanif Kureishi, and the rest of the team."
16566,"What a moving film. I have a dear friend who is in her sixties and for the past 15 years has told me that people don't see her anymore, and she longs for companionship. You are no longer youthful, beautiful or"
16567,"The Mother is the rare kind of film that is perhaps too honest for American audiences to tolerate having no car chase, no bling, no rap soundtrack to drown out the cretin performances by TV starlets and buff studmuffins"
16568,One of Kureishi's best films..and one of his best movies..and one of his best movies..and one of his best movies..and one of his best movies..and one of his best
16569,A fascinating and interesting film - not just for the elderly. I found myself discussing the film and the characters for hours afterwards. It's a great and valuable film - slightly off mainstream but that does not mean that this film cannot be enjoyed
16570,"""The Mother"" is a weird low-budget movie, touching at least two uncomfortable themes not usually explored in the cinema: denial of love of mother for their own son and daughter, and lust and passion in the third age."
16571,"A mother's love for a man about half her age hurts the people around her.<n>The Mother may not be everyone's favorite, but it is definitely not your usual matinée show to go along with tea and scones"
16572,"""If I sit down I will never stand up again"", that's what the mother (the one of the title) says to his son when he tells her to get some rest (she's just widowed)"
16573,"A film that will leave the viewer with many, perhaps conflicting, reactions. It is a film worth discussing and debating, and above all, worth seeing."
16574,"""The Mother"" does an excellent job of dealing with uncomfortable issues realistically while avoiding gratuitous sensationalism. Will play best with more mature audiences, possibly women, who may better empathize with the central character, her needs and issues."
16575,This is a really interesting film. It's the first time I have seen the relationship between an older woman and a younger guy on screen without it being sensationalist
16576,"One of those films that you know is good, maybe even great, but it is like eating vegetables or doing math homework is to a kid - too much work and a whole lot of pain to get invested in."
16577,"I am a college student studying a-levels and need help and comments from anyone who has any views at all about the theme of mothers in film, in the mother"
16578,I'd been caught by Anne Reid's compelling performance and I was hooked. The sex scenes were fascinating and taboo-breaking. Shouldn't older women's bodies remain covered up? Not here and we're treated to a
16579,"One of my all-time favorite James Bond films, and I'm glad I'm still watching it today! I'm glad I stuck with it!"
16580,"One of the best McDoakes movies of all time, with lots of pizazz, surprises, &amp; pizazz, &amp; lots of pizazz!"
16581,George O'Hanlon and Joe McDoakes get a break in the film industry in this very funny short subject about a young actor trying to break into film.
16582,So You Want to Be in Picutres is the funniest Joe McDoakes short I've seen so far and so far the best!
16583,"Drug Films: The Trip Easy Rider Up In Smoke Reefer Madness Blow Boogie Nights is a must see for anyone interested in the ""Drug Years"" of the 60's and 70's."
16584,Martin Torgoff is my uncle and I am so darn proud of him. This mini-series that in shown on VH1 is a great look at the culture of drugs in the past 30 years and my uncle worked very hard on it
16585,"Martin Torgoff's ""Can't Find My Way Home"" is a must-see for stoners and drug users alike. A must-see for anyone interested in the 1960's experiments with LSD."
16586,A must-see for anyone interested in the 60's/70's/'80's/'90's rock and hipper movement.
16587,The Drugs Years on VH1 is a must see for all drug addicts and drug abusers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
16588,One of the best films I've ever seen about the 60's - and it's not just for the young and the old. You've got to see it to understand it.
16589,"Not as good as a Ken Burns documentary, but still worth a look for the young and the 'old' who can reflect some decades later about the great peaks, careless times, and then the disillusionment prodded more by the same media that years"
16590,"Good entertainment, but it should be viewed as the sanitized fictionalization that it is.<n>One of the most shameful parts of the film is the depiction of the killing of John Dillinger"
16591,"One of those carefully supervised films that showed the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the best possible light. While it's 48 year director J. Edgar Hoover was alive, it would be showed in no other kind of light."
16592,"The FBI will always be there. At least that's the feeling you get after watching the gripping but slightly mellow crime drama, The FBI story. It traces the roots of the organization from a small bureau to one of the most modern facilities"
16593,Jimmy Stewart as J.Edgar Hoover and Vera Miles as his wife is a good story of a life in the FBI as told by Jimmy Stewart and Vera Miles as his devoted wife is also good.
16594,James Earl Jones is the waiter who is serving when Hagarty's wife reveals that she is pregnant while they are at the restaurant next to the lake.
16595,"One of the best FBI films I've ever seen. James Stewart is excellent as Chip Hardesty, a hard-working and dedicated FBI agent."
16596,"One of the better Columbo movies of the '70's and '80's, with Ruth Gordon and G.D. Spradlin in the lead roles."
16597,"A good episode, but there's a plot hole that needs to be fixed. I don't know what I'm going to do about it."
16598,One of the best of many great Columbo installments. This is one of the best of many great Columbo installments. I loved it but there should have been some quick reference to the secretary getting punished for effectively being an accomplice after the fact
16599,Ruth Gordon as Agatha Christie-type murder mystery author.<n>Mariette Hartley as Gordon's secretary and would-be blackmailer..
16600,Mysterious Death of Edmund Garvin in Abigail Mitchell's Walk-in Safe...........
16601,"I've never seen a Columbo film before, but this one is worth a watch. It's surprisingly good for a TV-movie.."
16602,Columbo's final appeal to his good nature is rejected because he has too much self-respect not to do his job well. Here is one situation you can't squirm out of Ms Mitchell!
16603,One of the few movies where you care about the characters -- even though the characters aren't perfect.<n>One of the few movies where you feel like you're looking in at people you'd never otherwise imagine.

16606,"The Film Noir Formula is all its glory--before the ingredients became clichés--and one hell of a climactic fistfight. Performances by Richard Widmark and Jean Peters are right on target, and the smart, sharp script is quite"
16607,"Thelma Ritter steals the show in Pickup on South Street, a tough, brutal, well made film about a pickpocket (Richard Widmark) who inadvertently aquires top-secret microfilm and becomes a target for espionage agents."
16608,One of the best movies I have ever seen in the F.N. era of movies! I loved it! I rate this movie one of the best I have seen in the FN genre! I rate this movie one of the best
16609,One of Richard Widmark's strongest roles. He is totally convincing in his performance. Jean Peter impressed so much here that I will definitely be on the lookout for her other work.
16610,"""Pickup On South Street"" is a high speed drama about a small time criminal who suddenly finds himself embroiled in the activities of a group of communists."
16611,One of the best little movies of the '50's and even better as it gets better and better with each passing day!brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
16612,"A good film that gets you involved straight away. Its a bit unrealistic how Jean Peters immediately falls in love with Widmark, but this point is necessary as otherwise why would she later hold out from Joey."
16613,One of the best anti-communist films of the 50's.........
16614,One of Samuel Fuller's best films...and it's still vivid after 55 years.......
16615,"One of the best films I have seen in a long, long time, and one of the best movies I have seen in a long, long time..."
16616,"One of Sam Fuller's best films. Widmark, Peters, Ritter, Kiley make it worth a look.<n>A great Noir-like film."
16617,"One of the best film noirs of the early 50's, with Widmark and Peters at their best.<n>Thelma Ritter is brilliant as the moll-with-a-heart-of-gold Candy"
16618,"One of Samuel Fuller's best, but a double complication sets in motion a degree of knowledge.<n>The feds can't stop the ""passing"" of government secrets or the spread of communism"
16619,"A ""Red Scare"" movie devoid of hysteria, in which the Communist threat is nothing more than the McGuffin that ignites the plot. Pickpocket Richard Widmark relieves loose woman Jean Peters of her wallet containing a strip of microfilm"
16620,"A good example of film noir, but the DVD is too expensive for my budget at the moment, or I would purchase it, because the film is a good example of film noir...and I enjoy watching Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and"
16621,"One of the best noirs I've seen in a long, long time........"
16622,'Pickup on South Street (1953)' is a strong film noir that succeeds most outstandingly in its evocation of setting  the underground of New York City.
16623,"""Pickup on South Street"" is one of the best film noirs I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it's a film noir."
16624,"One of Widmark's best performances in a long time.<n>Fuller's ""film noir"" school of film-making is off-set by a host of colorful characters."
16625,"Fuller's ""Pickup on South Street"" is one of the best films of the 1950's......"
16626,"""Pickup on South Street"" is one of Sam Fuller's best films...and it's not just because it was directed by him, it's because it was."
16627,"Pickup on South Street is a film-noir that's not just about the femme fatale...it's about the good guys, too."
16628,"One of Sam Fuller's best, and Thelma Ritter's best performance is the highlight of the movie..a must see for any Fuller fan."
16629,"Thelma Ritter did steal the picture. I just finished watching it again. I couldn't help becoming emotional in her final scene. Richard Widmark never had a better part and was perfect casting as a 3-D, flawed human being. Jean"
16630,The Red Scare ruled the politics of the McCarthy era in 1953. Jean Peters is amazing as the girl flamed by Widmark. The film is a period piece during the McCarthy era where the Red Scare ruled the politics and is worked
16631,"""Pickup on South Street"" is a great action-paced noir thriller. ""Shock Corridor"" remains my favorite Fuller film, but this is a very close second."
16632,A pretty decent example of film noir. The setting is the early 50's with the Communists trying to steal weapon secrets from the US Government. Richard Widmark is the suave pickpocket without scruples.
16633,One of the best horror films I've ever seen (and I've seen it more than once)...and I've seen it more than once..and I've seen it more than once..and I
16634,"This movie has everything that makes a bad movie worth watching - sloppy editing, little to no continuity, insane dialog, pointless story lines, shots that go on FAR too long...and it's perfect for MST3K-style riffing"
16635,"One of the best war movies I've seen in a long, long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long, long time."
16636,A wonderful movie that describes the account of a group of Australian commandos who tried to sink some Japanese ships at the Singapore harbor during the height of WW2
16637,One of the best war movies I've ever seen--and I've seen it many times over the years--and I've never forgotten it.
16638,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, but it's hard to believe it's been so long since I've seen it."
16639,I was overtaken by the emotion. Unforgettable rendering of a wartime story which is unknown to most people. I was overtaken by the emotion. Unforgettable rendering of a wartime story which is unknown to most people.
16640,"This is the story of Australian commandos who are captured out of uniform after a raid. Since they are out of uniform, they are, justly, treated as spies."
16641,"A true reflection of the Australian resourcefulness that has been required to make this country what it is over the last 200 years. Not pompous like the British, not Gung-Ho like the Americans."
16642,A delightful piece of cinema storytelling in a simple but effective way. Cinema after all is a visual media and Igor used its full potential. A young restless man boards a train with no destination in mind. In one of the compartments he meets with
16643,"An amazing film. With very little dialogue, the whole story is told with glances and body language. Very involving almost voyeuristic. My only gripe is that it has not been released on video in Australia and is therefore only available"
16644,"""Ekspres, Ekspres"" is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've ever seen."
16645,"... when this movie so well proves that they indeed are unnecessary.brbrAlthough few lines, it was kind of weird to see this movie, no subs, in a language unknown."
16646,"A kind of road movie in old-fashioned trains in the Slowenian late summer province. At the beginning you see someone in underwear sewing trousers from black cloth, and when the same young man in his black trousers leaves the house with two"
16647,"Go, Igor, go, you are the proof that Slovenian films may, should and must be different. There's soul in it, and this is rare. Don't let anybody put you down!"
16648,"I'm not quite sure what I'm looking at"" look intuitively strikes me as more like how a real supernatural vision would be. The movie's The-End-Question-Mark type ending is one of the only ones that"
16649,"One of Richard Crenna's best movies... but not quite as good as 'Hound of Hell', but still a good Halloween fare....."
16650,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time, but it's a little too low budget for it's own good!"
16651,"Not bad, but, lacks any chills or surprises. The movie is not really bad, but, really lacks any chills or surprises. Although, I did like the scene where Richard Crenna shoots the family dog to no avail."
16652,"The Devil Dog: Hound of Hell is really good film! I liked the effects on the dog and the creature itself looked really cool with its horns,frill like part on his neck, and acted really viscous!"
16653,"""Devil Dog,The Hound of Hell"" is a great 70's made-for-TV horror movie.It's worth watching.It's one of the many 70's made-for-TV horror movies that was actually scary"
16654,"The worst TV movie of the 70's, but it's still funny.........."
16655,"""Galaxy Express 999"" remains as captivating as the first time you discovered it all those years ago. ""Good-bye, Maetel. Good-bye, Galaxy Express 999..."
16656,"Galaxy Express is one of those films that sticks in your imagination for a long time. If you've never understood the appeal of anime, discovering this film may be your golden ticket to Otaku-town."
16657,"It's one of the best movies I've ever seen, and it's not just because it's a sci-fi movie. It's because it's a sci-fi movie."
16658,Galaxy Express 999 (Ginga tetsud Three-Nine). Made in 1979. Based on the original work by Leiji Matsumoto. We follow Maetel
16659,One word can describe this movie and that is weird. I recorded this movie one day because it was a Japanese animation and it was old so I thought it would be interesting.
16660,"A must-see for any anime fan! A must-see for any animation fan! A must-see for any ""Star Blazers"" fan! A must-see for any anime fan!"
16661,What can I say? An action and allegorical tale which has just about everything. Basically a coming of age tale about a young boy who is thrust into a position of having to save the world.....
16662,The Galaxy Express is a rather good early Anime movie. I caught it once on the Science Fiction channel when Anime was actually popular here in America and not the ratings disaster that adult swim claims it is on the cartoon network.
16663,"One of the best episodes I've seen from the house of Bruckheimer, and one of the best episodes of Cold Case I've ever seen."
16664,"What a stunning episode for this fine series. The story takes place in 1968 and it's beautifully filmed in black & white, almost a film noir style with its deep shadows and stark images."
16665,One of the all time best episodes. Officer Sean Cooper was murdered in his patrol car back in '68. A dying convict in the state penitentiary reveals that he stole a block of heroin from the car after the shooting. His case is reopened
16666,"one of the best episodes i've ever seen of Cold Case. i've watched it over and over again, and i'll watch it again and again."
16667,The Best Cold Case Episode I've Seen In A Long Time...and I've Seen It Many Times...and I'm Still Missing My Partner!
16668,An honest portrayal of a police officer in the closet and his secret love with another fellow cop. We thought it was a marvelous account of a serious matter no one talked about in those days.
16669,"I watch Cold Case because of the real life experiences depicted. This one was very close to me and touched me deeply, so beautifully handled, thanks, Merideth"
16670,"One of the funniest films I've seen in a long, long time. It's a feminist classic. I love it. I can't wait to see it on DVD!"
16671,"Not Dr. Strangelove o Young Frankenstein, it's a silly flick. It's a silly flick, with three great female leads (can't remember any other comedy with similar characteristics), Rachel Dracht and Amy Poehler from SNL"
16672,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time! I laughed so hard I couldn't keep my eyes off of it! I can't wait to see it again!
16673,"One of the funniest films I've seen in a long, long time. It's a must see for all girls who grew up in the 80's and 90's."
16674,This is pure girl FUN with the most fantastic cast of female leads. And the only downside I see to this film is that Tina Fey was not in it- besides that it stars the smartest and brightest girls on the planet.
16675,"The best ""bad"" movie ever made, and it's not just because it's so bad. It's because it's so good."
16676,"If you ever, EVER, have the chance to see this movie see it. If you need chop off your arm to see it, see it. It's worth it."
16677,"FATTY DRIVES THE BUS is simply the funniest, most original and entertaining piece of work i have ever had the pleasure of seeing. i don't care how you get it, rent it, order it, steal it, download it"

16679,One of the funniest shows I have ever seen!! I have laughed harder during this show than any other I have ever seen!! I can only hope that this will someday be released on DVD with special many bonus special features.
16680,I love the show but it is with some reservations and I feel it took the easy way out by Spoiler Spoiler:brbrCrashing and burning everything at the end of the second season.
16681,"One of the best movies of the 1930's, one of the best movies of the 1940's, one of the best movies of the 1950's, one of the best movies of the 60's, one of the best"
16682,"Olivier, Oberon, Richardson, Barnes, &amp; Selden all shine in this romantic comedy....."
16683,The Divorce of Lady X is one of the best movies I have ever seen in a long time. It's a must-see for any Laurence Olivier fan.
16684,One of the best romantic comedies I've seen in a long time. Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon are wonderful. A delight to watch. Ralph Richardson was a delight to watch as well.
16685,"Laurence Olivier, Merle Oberon, Ralph Richardson, and Binnie Barnes star in ""The Divorce of Lady X,"" a 1938 comedy based on a play."
16686,An incredible little English film for so many reasons. First it's a rare look a Laurence Olivier in a light comedy. While his performance is not up the standard he would latter set as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century
16687,Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon's first film together.<n>Olivier's first screwball comedy....
16688,"One of Olivier's best performances in a long time, and one of his best in a long time, and one of his best in a long time."
16689,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it a few times, but never as good as this one."
16690,"It's a cooking competition show, Americanized. It's not going to be the Japanese version.brbrThe show is great. I could care less about cooking but this show is just entertaining to watch..."
16691,"One of the best shows I have seen in a long time. My children love it. It is a great hour of entertainment, as well as informational. Best of all in our hussle, bussle life, it is"
16692,I like the new Iron Chef because it is similar enough to the Japanese version but at the same time caters to American spirit. The Iron Chefs themselves are very interesting. I know the originals were probably the best chefs on the planet at the
16693,"What a night. Perry Mason then Have Gun, Will Travel followed by Gunsmoke (when it was a half hour) and finally came 'Sea Hunt' with its wonderful opening theme music and Mike's boat sailing off to a new adventure"
16694,"I loved watching ''Sea Hunt '' back in the day, I was in grammar school and would get home do my homework and by 4:30 would be ready to watch ''Sea Hunt '' and Mike Nelson in his underwater adventures.I loved"
16695,Lloyd Bridges at his best as a scuba diver in the early 1970's..........
16696,"""SEA HUNT"" was the top syndicated TV Series, a success that ZIV Series had known before with S.U.B.A.***"
16697,I would like to see a resurrection of a up dated Seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in me.I grew up on black and white TV and Seahunt with Gunsmoke were my hero'
16698,"One of Kurosawa's best, but not as well known as some of his other films. I thought it was wonderful. An episodic multi-character study of Tokyo's poorest, who live in a city literally made from garbage."
16699,"Dodes' Ka-Den is Kurosawa's first color film. It's not Kurosawa's best, but it's better than 99% of today's films."
16700,"Kurosawa's first colour film is a darkly surreal look into the tragic lives of Tokyo slum dwellers. Swinging from comedy to tragedy and back, this film shows how people deal with the worst kind of life each in their own way."
16701,"Dodes'ka-den is a little post-apocalyptic, but in tragic scope, meant to be deconstructed through dramatic force. It's a marginalized society, but the concerns of these people are shattered through dramatic force."
16702,"""D desu ka den"" is the first colored movie of Master Akira Kurosawa, and surprisingly is not about samurais, ronins, warlords or battlefields"
16703,"Dodes'ka-den (DKD) is a prime example of this type of film. brbrI will also argue, to the last, that this is Kurosawa's greatest achievement."
16704,One of the weirder movies I have recently watched. That's because it seems less like a movie and more like an experimental film. Kurasawa's experiment was to take a variety of individuals who live at a garbage dump and
16705,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've been waiting for it to come out on DVD, & I'm glad I finally got it."
16706,The sound that one of the characters makes as he drives his imaginary trolley across the garbage dump where the characters live. The film is based on a series of stories by Shugoro Yamamoto and tells the story of a group of people who effectively
16707,"Onomatopoeic, the sound of a streetcar clacking on the rails. It is metaphoric for all that the people who live in the dump cannot have."
16708,"A great film, even if it's not the greatest Kurosawa film. I was greatly affected by the scene of the man and the children who he raises as his own."
16709,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best of the Kurosawa's I've seen so far."
16710,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once.
16711,"Kurosawa loses sight of his usual themes of truth and perception of reality and opts for a depressing take on Tokyo's slums. Poorly paced, poorly conceived, this movie is a rare dud in this auteur body of excellent work"
16712,"I loved this movie! It's truly bizarre, extremely funny, morbid, witty... It makes no sense to tell about the contents of the movie, because then I'd be giving out the outcome!"
16713,"Jedna ruka netlesk isn't intellectual, it's just a comedy. It's not for the intellectuals, it's for the non-Czechs."
16714,"Cruel true reality. Situations are very funny. You have to laugh when you see, how people can be stupid, obstinate and crazy. The best description will be, if you watch it on..."
16715,"Czech humour by its very nature is dark and often uncompromising, but often with a naive and warm sentiment behind it. This film is just that, it is unkind and deals with the less lovable sides of human beings"
16716,Standa and Ondrej are the best of the best Czech films.........
16717,"I like this movie much, it's special type of humor by Ondricek and Machacek... I think it's better then Samotari (Loners)"
16718,"The Beast is one of the most daring films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time."
16719,"""La Bte"" by Walerian Borowczyk is based on the short story ""Lokis"" written by Prosper Merimée.Lucy Broadhurst(Lisabeth Hummel),arrives at the family's crumbling ch"
16720,"One of the most bizarre films I've seen in a long time - but I'm not sure if I'd rate it as ""good"" or ""bad"""
16721,One of the best films ever made about our nature and our sexual nature.........
16722,"One of the more unique films you're ever going to see. If you can see it that is, no mean feat considering how hard it is to find copies of it"
16723,"Not what I expected, but I'm glad I didn't have to read the synopsis on the back of the DVD box and read that it had been banned for 25 years!"
16724,Peter Falk's best performance as a Columbo..a must see for all Columbo fans..a must see..a.k.a.
16725,A film that will make you think...and smile. Paul Reiser and Peter Falk take you on a journey that you will not forget. The soundtrack is beautifully varied and fitting; and the film itself is like a breath of fresh air.
16726,Peter Falk and Paul Reiser are great together in this movie.It's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
16727,"THE THING ABOUT MY FOLKS is a fine little film about family and what we see and what we don't see, what we expect and what surprises us."
16728,Peter Falk & Paul Reiser at their best in a very good film.brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr

16732,Excellent film with Peter Falk and Paul Reiser joining forces as father and dad. It becomes a story of courage and the human spirit in the face of adversity.
16733,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time - and I've seen it more than once!...And I've seen it more than once!
16734,"A great comedy/drama about unresolved issues with parents. I'm a fan of Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, and this is a great movie."
16735,"I enjoyed this film, perhaps because I had not seen any reviews, etc. It was delightful and a little bit of a 'romp'. I don't know why it didn't make more of a splash than it did"
16736,"One of the best movies I have ever seen. I feel greatly touched by the theme the movie intends to convey. One sentence that keeps coming up on my mind is that ""history repeats itself""."
16737,A very moving movie with a great cast! Paul Reiser and Olympia Dukakis are great! A must see! A must see! A wonderful night out!

16747,"The 1985 version is better than the 2005 version, but it's not perfect. It's not perfect, and the sentimentality may make you wince at times. It's not perfect, but I defy you not to cry -"
16748,"I like this presentation - I have read Bleak House and I know it is so difficult to present the entire book as it should be, and even others like Little Dorrit - I have to admit they did a very good show with the"
16749,"A very good adaptation of Dickens' novel, but it's not quite as good as the book, and it's not quite as good as the TV series"
16750,The best adaptation of a classic novel known to me. The representation of the court of Chancery as a 'character' in the drama is magnificent. But it is the spider's web of chancery that holds the whole thing together.
16751,"This production needs its seven hours. Probably, it needs even longer, because many elements of suspense plot are not sufficiently clear, or as well handled, as they need to be."
16752,A great adaptation and a great miniseries in its own right. The plot cutdowns might disappoint the fans of the book (but really how many modern readers have read Bleak House without seeing a film version first? I know of only a few
16753,"If you're a thinker, this movie delivers. Exponentially. Absolutely mesmerizing. If you view the blacks in this movie as token' you may want to reassess YOUR angst. You may be seeing only black and"
16754,I'll keep this one quite short. I believe that this is an extraordinary movie. I see other reviewers who have commented to the effect that it's...
16755,What good writing in a movie should be all about. Kasdan takes the search for meaning in our lives and lays it out for all to see and wonder at.
16756,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more times than I've seen it. I've seen it more times than I've seen it.
16757,"If it came on t.v. right now, would you want to sit there and watch it again? The Grand Canyon is as powerful a ""yes"" as it would be for nearly any movie I have ever seen"
16758,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and I still like it. I think it's one of Lawrence Kasdan's best."
16759,"One of the most affecting films I've ever seen. I've watched it several times now and I still feel as I did the first time; that this film, by itself, could make up the entire curriculum of a post-"
16760,"A great film, one that takes its time to develop, it keeps coming close to going over the edge but never does and ultimately is meditative, affecting, and truer to life than most films people who dismiss its ""coincidences"" can"
16761,"A great film, a powerful film, a healing film. I've seen it six times now, and it entertains and inspires me with every subsequent viewing. But why the poor reviews for this movie? Maltin's movie guide"
16762,"A very clever film, with very clever dialogs and food for thought everywhere from start to end. I have the impression that it never made it to it's deserved ranking (and never will)"
16763,One of the most powerful movies ever made about life for Americans in the 90s and it even carries over into today's world in which we live in
16764,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time."
16765,One of the rare films to explore the strange coincidences that lead to the success of actors and directors in Hollywood.<n>The actors make you believe they are experiencing these new realities. Maybe this is a subject we should explore more often.
16766,"This is Kasdan's best film, his most mature, his most humane. A major meditation on life from one of our most gifted writers and directors. Hopefully we haven't heard the last from Larry Kasdan."
16767,"One of the better films I've seen in a long time, but it's not as good as I'd've liked it to be"
16768,"""Grand Canyon"" is a great movie. It affirms Kevin Kline as my favorite actor. Also starring Mary McDonnell, Mary-Louise Parker and Alfre Woodard."
16769,A film that will touch you in one way or another. To me this substantiates Grand Canyon as a film that will touch you in one way or another.
16770,One of the best urban films i've seen in a long time.........
16771,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, but it's not as good as it could have been....."
16772,This is an excellent movie with a stellar cast and some great acting. I never tire of watching it. I especially love the scene where Danny Glover's character and Kevin Kline's character namely Simon and Mack have brunch together.
16773,"... but watch Mary McDonnell's performance closely. Her body language. Her fine body movements. And the rest of the cast were pretty damned good, too!"
16774,One of the best movies I've ever seen. I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once.
16775,"One of those ordinary ""soapies"" relating the day to day events of half a dozen families whose lives are intertwined...broken relationships,building new friendships, street bashings, near accidents, hopes and dreams and even the discovery"
16776,"If you haven't seen it, DO! It's worth a look!                "
16777,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time. It's a must see for anyone who lives in the LA area."
16778,A film maker brings to life a unique group of people and lets you inside to see the things that make us human. Lawrence Kasden done this again. I always felt theBg Cill was the anthem of it's age and

16781,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long, long time!"
16782,"Alain Chabat is a fine actor, writer and director but maybe a trifle misguided to take an 'idea' credit for a story that probably had them rolling in the aisles when Aristophanes was still learning that it's 'i'"
16783,"One of the best romantic comedies I've seen in a long time, but not all of us will like it. I don't know what I'm talking about."
16784,"One of the best 50 or so Films I have seen this year, and well worth a five start rating. I look forward to adding this one to the DVD collection when it is released and highly recommend it to all ages."
16785,I think Charlotte Gainsbourg is one of the best performers in the world. I can't understand why some people say she's not. Boring....???
16786,I'm in love with that woman! I got what I expected...but only half. This film should deliver expectations for those who enjoy all kinds of romantic comedies or stories involving intelligent humor and light dramatic situations.
16787,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and I've seen it over and over again, and over and over, and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over"
16788,This is an Excellent little movie! The acting is good and the music is fantastic!! Play it on a 5-1 sound system and enjoy!!1 P.S.

16790,"One of the best movies ever made in the comedy category. And yet its appearance of a theatre play transformed into a feature film takes nothing of its value. A masterpiece one should not miss to see (preferably with subtitles, and not dubbed)."
16791,"One of the most accurate portrayals of the mentality that seems to have pervaded the Balkans yet again, 45 years after the time depicted. One of the funniest movies I've ever seen."
16792,An outstanding example of Serbian mentality. A milestone in Eastern European film making and an outstanding example of Serbian mentality. A group of completely different people are doomed to die because of their discord.
16793,"Superbly developed characters into the lots of funny situations full of spirit, absurdness and Serbian mentality. Movie is a great comedy, enjoyable, interesting, unpredictable. Best point in a film: characters, then humor itself, story and dialogs"
16794,"One of my favourite ""domestic"" movies. I don't know if there is any person in our country who hasn't seen this movie! It's funny, and sad at some moments...I don't know how did"
16795,One of the funniest movies ever made about the fall of the Serbian nation in 1941 and the fall of the Soviet Union in the post-World War II era.
16796,"I'd be happy to have the chance to stumble on this film again, as it shines in my >celluloid memories. Ever since seeing Who's Singing Over >There"" 15 years ago I still hear the theme tune,"
16797,"This is the movie I've seen more times than any other (I believe I saw it on average once every year since it was released). And every time I see it, it is equally fantastic and always reveals something new to me."
16798,One of the best films I ever saw. A tragicomedy with very deep implications on the fate of humankind shown through the eyes of seemingly very plain and common people from a God-forsaken Serbian province just before the start of the
16799,Who's Singing Over There : simply exceptional!<n>A film is never really good unless the camera is an eyes in the head of a poet Orson Welles!
16800,"I'm surprised there were so many comments about this movie. I saw it as part of a Slavic film festival at a major American University. But nobody in USA has heard of it, which is a real shame!"
16801,"I like this movie a lot, but it's a fact, that you cannot understand it, unless you're from the ex Yugoslavia. Most of the actors are now dead and those were the best actors in ex Yugoslavia."
16802,This is the best Serbian movie I have ever seen. It is very good comedy. I surely like it!!!! I watched this film over a hundred times. It is really best Serbian movie made ever. I wood like to recommend this movie to

16808,WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE? is a musical fantasy that deserves to be seen and heard. It is a must-see for anyone who has ever seen a Kurt Weill/Gershwin film.

16814,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
16815,A great movie about a family in the 60s...........
16816,One of the most moving films I've seen in a long time. Solino really moved me with its deeply drawn characters. What I liked most about the movie was how I could identify with the feelings Gigi was going through.
16817,A nice film about a family who emigrates from Italy to Duisburg in the Ruhr area in the 60s.<n>It shows problems which many foreign families have when they come to another country: they have to get used to a
16818,"Great movie with great actors to show that life is not funny all the time, but that you can find happiness with ""fire and passion"" as the main character Gigi would say"
16819,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.........
16820,This is a great movie with a great script and a great acting team. I really enjoyed this movie. It brought tears into my eyes a few times but left me with a great feeling afterwards.
16821,This is a great movie with a great script and a great acting team. I really enjoyed this movie. It brought tears into my eyes a few times but left me with a great feeling afterwards.
16822,"really excellent movie, one of the best i've seen. Touching and simple - just like life, sometimes you cry sometimes you laugh and it's just beautiful. not too much of anything, just as it's suppose to"
16823,a very good action film with a very humane story and a very good selection of music...... a very good acting performance by Moritz Bleibtreu and Barnaby Metschurat
16824,"I liked SOLINO very much. It is a very heart-rending story of an Italian family moving to Germany. And it's a story about brotherly love, hope and disappointment."
16825,One of the best short films I've seen in a long time - and I've seen it a few times too.......
16826,"Knuckleface Jones is one of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time... and I've seen it more than once!"
16827,"it is a celebration of life and an optimistic assertion of objective truth and good. representing along an axis unexplored in previous cinema, this film should be taught in every high school."
16828,One of Harlow's best roles. A must-see for all Harlow fans. A must-have for any fan of hers. A must-have for anyone who has never seen RED-HEADED WOMAN.
16829,"""You oughta scratch me off your list - I'm not a ladies man"".... I wonder what that line would have been just a couple years earlier before the Hayes code came rolling into town. What was he really saying?"""
16830,The Girl From Missouri is a must see for anyone who loves Marilyn Monroe and the Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
16831,"This film has slipped through the cracks of film history. It is by far much better than some other New York films of the same era such as: ""The French Connection"" or ""The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3"""
16832,One of the best cop-buddy movies of the '70s! Why isn't this out on DVD now!? It's a must-see!
16833,"One of the best films made in the 20th century. It should be on DVD. It could have been a franchise. Release on DVD is a must. Look for it in your TV guide and if you see it listed, no matter"

16835,The arch title doesn't fit this gentle romantic comedy. Donna Reed and Tom Drake don't have much chemistry -- but their characters aren't supposed to.
16836,"Postwar hilarity. Tom Drake and Grandpa from ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" two years later (the year I was born). Donna Reed charming and pretty. Margaret Hamilton good as always; smaller part..."
16837,"Above-average post-war romantic comedy, but it's not so much a ""straight"" romantic comedy as it is stunt-casting at its funniest."
16838,"Not as sexy as the first two movies but still fun to watch. Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter & Paul Giamatti chew up the scenery as a trio of apes."
16839,"Take this movie for what it is, not a remake, but a completely different approach to the same concept. It's not an epic like the original, it's more of a popcorn thriller. Everything else was just OK."
16840,This movie sucks! It's not as good as the original and it doesn't deal with the same subject as the original. If you want a good ape movie watch the original.

16844,One of the best films I've seen in a long time - more deserving of a DVD release than a straight to DVD release here in the U.K.
16845,One of the best episodes of the series..and one of the best episodes ever..and one of the best episodes..and one of the best episodes..and one of the best episodes..and one of the best

16848,Ruth Gordon at her best. This episode is my favorite of the whole Columbo series. Peter Falk and Ruth Gordon worked so well together that they should both be inducted into the television hall of fame
16849,"One of the best Columbo films I've ever seen, and one of the best I've seen in a long, long, long time."
16850,Ruth Gordon is one of the best Columbo episodes ever. Mariette Hartley and G. D. Spradlin are excellent in their supporting roles. And Peter Falk delivers a little something extra in his scenes with Gordon.
16851,"I love this episode of Columbo. Maybe it's because Ruth Gordon is in it and she is wonderful as successful mystery writer Abigail Mitchell, an American version of Dame Agatha Christie. She is delicious to watch as the perky, lovable author"

16858,"Sinatra, Kelly, Grayson, &amp; Sidney make Anchors Aweigh a pretty good film despite its flaws.<n>The music is a strange combination of militaristic music--what the stars tend to sing in more informal settings "
16859,"""Anchors Aweigh"" is a great comedy! Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra make such a funny team! Kathryn Grayson is gorgeous and really sweet. Dean Stockwell is the cutiest child actor I've never seen."
16860,"Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson, and Jose Iturbi star in ""Anchors Aweigh""<n>""Anchors Aweigh"" is a very energetic musical with great dancing and singing by Kelly and Sinatra."
16861,"A bit too long for a light musical but it doesn't drag. At nearly two and half hours, it is a bit too long for a light musical but it doesn't drag."
16862,One of the best musicals of the 1940's - and it's not just because it's Gene Kelly - it's the best of his career.
16863,"One of MGM's best but it's too long and too silly. Still worth catching. Kelly, Sinatra and Grayson are the stars. It's a great movie!"

16866,ANCHORS AWEIGH is an entertaining MGM musical that fans of the genre will enjoy but I wouldn't rate it up there with classics like SINGIN IN THE RAIN or THE BAND WAGON
16867,the greatest movie of all time..the greatest without reserve..the greatest without reserve..the greatest without reserve..the greatest without reserve..the greatest without reserve..the greatest without reserve.
16868,ANCHORS AWEIGH is one of the best MGM musicals of the 1940's...and it's not just because it's Sinatra and Kelly.
16869,"One of the first of the best Technicolor musicals, with a lot of memorable musical sequences......."
16870,"One of Gene Kelly's best movies. I really liked it. I would put it above his more famous American in Paris. Sometimes it seems the story gets lost in Gene Kelly movies to the wonderful dance and song numbers, but not in"
16871,"Don't waste your time on this one. It's not that bad, but it's not the Kelly/Sinatra-suit musical you usually hear about."
16872,"It's not exactly sitting down, but it's a square solid lump of sugar that somehow melts in your mouth and despite the guilt, is still a pleasant feeling."
16873,Not as good as Astaire's 'Follow the Fleet' but not as bad as Sinatra's 'On The Town' but a bit too long
16874,"One of the great musical movies I grew up with with with such great entertainers as Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, not to mention the petite and glorious voice of Kathryn Grayson"
16875,"Lots of singing and dancing in this one, especially by Gene Kelly. Two sailors go on liberty to see if they can find love and romance. They meet up with a woman who is trying to break into show business. Musical lovers only."

16877,"""Soft for Digging"" is a fantastic experimental horror with lots of creepy atmosphere to spare.Some scenes are genuinely nightmarish and the acting is excellent.The location sets provide plenty of creepiness.Give this strange horror film a chance.9"
16878,I really think I should make my case and have every(horror and or cult)movie-buff go and see this movie...brbrI did!
16879,"This is a wonderfully spooky film. Don't be swayed by the naysayers. This was a thesis project for the writer/director, JT Petty. He did a great job of having me on the edge of my seat"
16880,"True atmosphere horror, with a visual narrative that makes it feel like you're watching a horror film, rather than a horror movie. A must-see for anyone who enjoys a good chilling to the bone scare."
16881,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once.
16882,"This is an excellent film and one should not be put off by its strangeness. There is genuine skill in manufacture of this work. It manages to be intrigiung, funny and frightening at various times"
16883,One of the best films from that period I've seen in a long time. Cobr Barbara Stanwyck and doing the 'Bunny Hug' is good enough reason to rent this film on DVD.
16884,"Barbara Stanwyck gives this early Douglas Sirk-directed, Universal-produced soap just the kick that it needs. Not nearly as memorable as Sirk's later melodramas, it's easy to see by watching ""All I"
16885,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, with Barbara Stanywck at the top of the list of actors I've ever seen."
16886,"One of Sirk's best, but it's little more than a minor piece of art......"
16887,"""Demons III: The Ogre"" is not ""Demons III: The Ogre"", but ""Demons III: The Ogre"" on the box art"
16888,"""La Casa dell'Orco"" has nothing to do with the ""Demons"" series, but it's still a good horror movie. I'm not saying it's not worth the look."
16889,Demons III: The Ogre is a good film as long as you don't compare it with Demons and Demons 2. Demons III: The Ogre is a good film as long as you don't compare it with Demons and Demons 2.
16890,"""The Ogre"" is not perfect, but it is very much worth seeing. Take it is a lesser Lamberto Bava achievement. And the monster itself was a scary one, when it was presented correctly."
16891,"Not as good as the first two, but still a decent horror film for those who like to rip-off other films...and Lamberto Bava makes the best of it!"
16892,"One of the best Italian horror films of the 1990's, and it's not just because it was directed by Lamberto Bava. It's because it's so good."
16893,The Tattooed Stranger - New York City in the 1950's and 60's - A B-type film that keeps the viewer involved in all that's going on
16894,"""The Tattooed Stranger"" is one of the best of the ""Dragnet"" era of crime films...but it's not as good as ""Naked City"" or ""Dragnet"""
16895,One of those rare B-movies that BBC2 screened over Christmas/New Year 2005-2006. See also They Live By Night and The Brighton Strangler.
16896,"A neat little crime drama which packs a lot into its 65 minute running time. It has all the right ingredients - a mystery corpse, a weary middle-aged cop Corrigan (Walter Kinsella) and his rookie sidekick Tobin (John Miles"

16899,One of the most beautiful films I've seen in a long time :pbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
16900,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a fan of it."
16901,One of the less widely lauded of recent Asian period action affairs Gojoe is an at first slow and often curious but overall pretty terrific offering. I'm sad to say I know virtually nothing of the Buddhist philosophy or Japanese history and legend that
16902,"Another good effort by Tadanobu Asano in my opinion. Well I really can't say anymore about the movie, but if you're only outlook on Asian cinema is Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or House of Flying Daggers"
16903,"Gojoe has the action, story and visuals to mesmerize any viewer. I strongly believe that with some skillful editing it can be sold in the U.S."
16904,"Sogo Ishii takes the old myth of Musashibo Benkei and stands it on its head to produce a dark, gory, spellbinding and terrific-looking movie"
16905,"Good production values, but hard to follow at times..........."
16906,"Another attempt by modern Japanese directors to redefine the chambara genre. Successful, and not, in varying degrees. Asano really doesn't move like a sword wielding demon, his acting is great but he would be an extra in a traditional"
16907,Gojoe is an anime- and Hong Kong-inspired samurai action flick with a pacifistic message. This ankle of the film is effectively portrayed through the protagonist (a great acting job done by Daisuke Ryu)
16908,GOJOE is one of the better samurai movies to come around post-Kurosawa.brbr8 out of 10brbr(go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of the movie
16909,"Well, if you are one of those Katana's film-nuts (just like me) you sure will appreciate this metaphysical Katana swinging blood spitting samurai action flick"
16910,Gojoe is part of a new wave of Japanese cinema. I would place director Sogo Ichii as one of the most interesting and creative of the new wave Japanese directors.

16915,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time........"
16916,"A masterpiece, filled with references to classic movies, from CASABLANCA to Chaplin's CITY LIGHTS. Gael Garcia Bernal plays a small role which is critical for the dramatic payoff of the story."
16917,One of those sleeper films that has a lot to say about life in a very traditional way. I actually watched it while sailing around Cuba on a western Caribbean cruise.
16918,"Dreaming of Julia was the title of the original script, and was filmed in the summer of 2000 in Santo Domingo Republica Dominicana. To release the picture they change the original name to Cuba Libre."

16934,"An unconventional historical drama, with some fine battle scenes. Tobey Maguire gives an excellent performance, and gets some pretty good back-up. The script is literate and pretty original, and the film is kept mercifully free of heroes."
16935,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and I've seen it more than once....."
16936,"One of my favorite movies which has been overlooked by too many movie goers, an observation which mystifies me. Not only directed by the acclaimed Ang Lee,it had many young actors who were to become major stars."
16937,"So, neighbor was killing neighbor, mois me of Iraq. Reminds me of our destruction/indifference to the Bill of Rights. I'm a Southerner, and must have some historical memory."

16939,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time. Maguire's a great actor, Jewel a great actress, and a great story."

16960,"Rob Roy has grown on me over the years. Partly because it largely avoids the faults I mind most in Braveheart. But also because Rob Roy is like fine wine, growing more mature and complex with each viewing."
16961,"A very engaging, intelligent, and well-made film. Liam Neeson and Tim Roth play their roles superbly. The cinematography is outstanding. This is a film I will enjoy watching again and again."

16996,"It's depressing to see where Jackie Chan has ended up. To be fair, he's now in his fifties and one would expect some slowdown. But with 'Rush Hour 3', he takes a back seat to Chris Tucker ("

17013,"Excellent portrayals of life with Cerebral Palsy, but not a complete portrait of the disabled as human beings. Most highly recommended. By no means a complete portrait, but fine examples of the disabled as human beings."
17014,"The triumph of a human will and spirit. The triumph of the cinema, and the triumph of an actor who did not act but who became his character."
17015,"A great movie for those with cerebral palsey. Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker give great performances. I find this movie to be inspirational. As someone who has lived with cerebral palsey for over forty years, I find this movie"

17019,One of the best films I've seen in a long time - but why didn't the Academy award O'Conor and McAnally?
17020,"My left foot is an epic outstanding film explaining the life and times of Christy Brown,who had cerebral palsy,a severe disability and had only the use of his left foot,but he was defiant,he managed to become an artist and writer"

17048,Great 80s movie for people in the Detroit area up in the 80s and now automotive engineers. I even work with a Japanese supplier so that makes this movie even more funny. Jay Leno was showing his age last night on The Tonight Show
17049,"If you don't know much about religion, you will miss a lot. You have to watch the movie more than once to understand it all. If you don't know much about religion, you will miss a lot."
17050,"A good movie for the sherlock fans,but is it a semi-biography of A.C. Doyle or is it just a movie?"
17051,"An excellent character study which has about the same amount of twists as any normal Sherlock Holmes case. I was looking forward to this and I wasn't disappointed. It was quite slow moving, with a lot of emphasis on Doyle's frustration"
17052,The last 40 minutes of this movie are excellent. If the first 50 minutes were as good the the the last 40 minutes this would have been a small masterpiece
17053,"Buster Keaton's first comedy feature. The Three Ages succeeds brilliantly as a comedy. They are simple boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl plots, but the period satires are riotous"
17054,"Buster Keaton's first feature film, but it's a lot better than you'd think. I liked it a lot and only wish I'd stumbled across it years ago."
17055,"One of Keaton's best, but it's not as good as he's made it out to be......."

17059,"One of the earliest comedic portrayals of the ""caveman"" stereotype, who wins his love not by romance but by brute force, as well as a funny twist on Roman gladiatorial combat"
17060,One of the ten best comedies ever brbrKeaton's comedy is like Lang's DESTINY upsidedownor  REBOURS
17061,This movie is really funny!! The General is Keaton's finest work but there are many of his works that are more hilarious - in this one are multiple sight gags and creative humor
17062,"Buster Keaton's voice is great, but it's not quite as good as ""Three Ages""<n>""The Goat"" is excellent, but it doesn't quite hang together"
17063,This is a very rare example of a movie about transvestitism. The film treats the taboo theme so that even a general audience not knowing of transvestitism at all will strongly sympathize with its main character.

17069,Adrian Pasdar is excellent is this film. He makes a fascinating woman. This is a fascinating film. Adrian Pasdar is excellent is this film. He makes a fascinating woman.
17070,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time -- and it's not just because of Adrian Pasdar's acting. It's because of the chemistry between him and Julie Walters.
17071,Julie Walters' best performance since Educating Rita. Adrian Pasdar gives his best performance to-date in the male lead. Educating Rita has been one of my role models.
17072,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time!"

17075,This movie changed my idea of what a movie should be..and it's not about the language..it's about a boy who had a dream..and who did everything to reach it..
17076,Frits is a powerful character and the film is beautifully photographed and powerfully acted. The film only weak point is the clichéd 'Flower Power' teacher who uses every 'friendly teacher' trick in the book. Other than this I feel sure
17077,"Insisting that Martin Luther King's inspirational spirit resides not just in American civil liberties but inside the hearts and minds of people everywhere, Niels Arden Oplev transplants this belief to a 1969 Danish middle school"
17078,The arrival of White Men in Arctic Canada challenges the freedom of a fearless ESKIMO hunter. A fascinating look at life in the Arctic among the Inuit.
17079,"A fascinating look at the life of Eskimos in Alaska.<n>The film-makers tried to make it seem very authentic, with the natives speaking only in an Eskimo language that was either translated by someone on screen or by intertitles"
17080,"I was really stunned how much a film, that's over 60 years old could impress me. It is nearly two hours long, there are absolutely no stars in it, there are subtitles but nevertheless it is interesting and exciting to watch."
17081,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time - and one of the best I've seen in a long, long time - and one of the best I've ever seen."
17082,"A serious movie about the cultural chasm between an indigenous population and the encroaching white man. Although filmed in a documentary style seemingly with non-professionals, Eskimo is a skilled production that contains a believable story the audience will want to see through to"
17083,"""Nanook of the north"" was the last word in archaic semi-doc 'eskimo' movies. How wrong! As an avid sea-kayaker I stayed up till 330am to watch this hoping to get a glimpse of"

17087,A romantic drama with many humorous undertones and a quick wit. This is a romantic drama with many humorous undertones and a quick wit. This is a romantic drama with many humorous undertones and a quick wit.
17088,"A gripping tale of intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge -- with a sharper picture and crisper sound. More enjoyable to see on DVD years after its PBS broadcast, with a sharper picture and crisper sound."
17089,"A good love story, very well-written and well-acted by all. Even a few 'laugh-out-loud' moments mixed in with some pretty serious observations on fidelity, age bias, and parental aging/Alzheimer's issues"
17090,"One of the better mini-series I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it's a mini-series."
17091,"An interesting portrayal of working class life in Northern England.<n>The film is an historical document and I personally enjoyed it, if only because of the way it conveyed a social phenomenon."
17092,One of the best films I've seen in a long time - and it's not just about the family. It's about all of us.
17093,One of the best films I've seen in a long time - and it's about to be made available on DVD too......
17094,"An excellent film about a traditional working class family in Northern England. Cleverly, the film, based on the play, portrays the complexities of family life."
17095,I can't agree more with Moira... but I want to say I cannot agree more with Moira.. but I want to say I cannot agree more with...
17096,"I love this film 'Spring and port wine'. I was born in Leigh, a town about 7 miles away from Bolton, I moved to Bolton in 1965 when I was 20."
17097,"Superb movie. Very good photography of 1969/70 Bolton, which seems now to be a different world. Thoughtful and an excellent dramatisation and production. James Mason a real first class star."
17098,"Fraidy Cat is scared to death all of the time, hence the name 'fraidy cat'. The cat is jumpy and scared to death all of the time, hence the name 'fraidy cat'"
17099,"One of the best Tom & Jerry cartoons I've ever seen, and it's on my list of the best Halloween cartoons of all-time!"
17100,"""Fraidy Cat"" is a good one. At least I like it, so I'm surprised that this is getting mixed reviews. It's more of a macabre story than a funny one, although it has its moments of comedy"
17101,"Not as good as other Tom and Jerry shorts, but still a good piece of Tom and Jerry history......"
17102,One of the best Tom & Jerry cartoons from the early 40's- and it's on disc one of the Tom & Jerry Spotlight Collection 2 set!
17103,"""Look at me, I'm dancin'!"" says the gleeful mouse king, ""Look at me, I'm dancin'!"""
17104,One of the Best Musical Comedy Movies of the 20th Century. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra are the Best of the 60's. One of the Best of the 70's.
17105,"ANCHORS AWEIGH, ON THE TOWN, ON THE TOWN, ON THE TOWN, ON THE TOWN, ON THE TOWN"
17106,One of the best dance sequences I've ever seen in a movie. One of the best of the 20th century. One of the most beautiful people of the 20th century.
17107,Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra at their best in Anchors Aweigh.<n>Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne at their best in Anchors Aweigh
17108,One of the best martial arts movies I have ever seen. I loved it. I am a sucker for the mild mannered secret identity and what could be more mild mannered than a pacifist librarian?
17109,"One of the best Jet Li films ever made! I'm a Jet Li fan, and this is one of his best! I can't wait to see it!"
17110,"One of Jet Li's best films, coming to U.S. on May 14......."
17111,"I loved it, my flatmate and myself spent the half hour after the film making strange Kung Fu noises and throwing beermat shurikens at each other. I can't explain it (well maybe a little tequila)"
17112,"One of Jet Li's best efforts. The action is rapid-fire, and special-effects boosted for intensity purposes. A little suspension of disbelief goes a long way in a Jet Li film."
17113,Jet Li and Lau Ching-Wan are the best of the Hong Kong Action Movie's.......
17114,One of the funniest films I've seen in a long time. Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious!
17115,'Break a Leg' is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. I've seen it a few times and loved it.
17116,"I was pleasantly surprised I quite liked this movie. Witty writing (some ""inside"" jokes I got, others I didn't - maybe due to actors speaking on top of one another), great acting (notably John Cassini), great cameo"
17117,"I don't know what I'm in for, but I'm glad I rented this movie......."
17118,"Kill Shot is one of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time."
17119,"A pretty decent B-movie, but not as good as it could have been, and not as good as it should've been. i'm not saying it's a B-movie, i'm saying it's"
17120,"Really enjoyed this little movie. It's a moving film about struggle, sacrifice and especially the bonds of friendship between different peoples (the child actor who plays Miki is especially good)"
17121,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time--and it's not just because it's a war movie. It's because it's realistic.
17122,Sad story of a downed B-17 pilot. Brady is shot down over occupied territory. The local ranchers extended him kindness and protection at the cost of their own lives
17123,"A beautiful movie, especially if you like horses.WWII films and the austere Hungarian Plateau.A story of courage, compassion and loyalty that transcends generations."
17124,This is a great movie for horse lovers and non-horse lovers alike! We will be purchasing it for our home DVD library. We will be recommending it to our friends.
17125,"this is a great movie, not just a one time around flick. its a keeper. i own it, and have watched it several times. its entertaining and comic in some spots and very tragic in others. Ladies have hankies handy,"
17126,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.........
17127,Don't waste your time or money on this movie. It's just too funny. Don't waste your time or money on this movie.

17129,"Johnny Dangerously is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long, long time......."
17130,"It's not perfect, but it has enough classic comedy bits to make it memorable. But like 'Porky's, this movie isn't perfect. But like 'Porky's, it has enough classic comedy bits to"
17131,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time - and I've seen it over and over again. I still laugh at it.
17132,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time..........
17133,"A breath of fresh air to come back and rediscover a truly funny farce like Johnny Dangerously.brbrNot perfect by a long shot, but definitely good for a smile on a bad day."
17134,One of the best spoofs I've ever seen - and it's not just because it was made in the '80s. It's because it was made in the '80s.
17135,One of the funniest films I've seen in a long time! Keaton's Johnny Dangerously Is Johnny Dangerously Is Johnny Dangerously Is Johnny Dangerously Is Johnny Dangerously Is Johnny Dangerously Is Johnny
17136,"""Johnny Dangerously"" is a hit and miss comedy. But I suggest to give it a chance. It does work. Not too many people give this movie a chance. Just think of it as a little parody of ""Goodfellas"
17137,One of the few movies my friends and I quote from all the time and this is fifteen years later (Maybe it was on Cinemax one too many times!)
17138,"Keaton is brilliant in this - as in most of his work. This is not a blockbuster, bigger-than-life affair. This is campy, slapstick humor played out by some of Hollywood's best (and very versatile) actors"
17139,"This movie is just a lot of fun. I've seen it a couple of times, but it always has something funny that I remember. The ""duckies and bunnies"" car scene is one of my favorites..."
17140,"One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time, and I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once."
17141,"Keaton, Heckerling, Piscopo, Henner, Stapleton, Boyle, Dunne, DeVito, Walston, DeVito, Walston..."
17142,"""Roman Troy Moronie"" is my comment on the movie. What else is there to say?brbrThis character really brings out the moron in Moronie. A tough gangster with an inability to pronounce profane words, well,"
17143,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : 
17144,"This did for crime what ""Not Another Teen Movie"" did for school. I laughed all the way through as 2 inept gangs warred with each other and among..."
17145,"Just like wine, ""Johnny Dangerously"" gets better and better with every day. This clever, witty, well-acted film could very well stand on its own..."
17146,"""Johnny Dangerously"" is one of Michael Keaton's best performances in a long time. It's a great gangster movie, and Keaton is terrific as the bad boy."
17147,One of the funniest movies i've seen in a long time. brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
17148,FUNNY! FUNNY! FUNNY! FUNNY! FUNNY! FUNNY! FUNNY! FUNNY! FUNNY! FUNNY! FUNNY! FUNNY! FUNNY! FUNNY! FUNNY! FUNNY!
17149,Johnny Dangerously is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time! I can't believe I've seen one like this!
17150,Johnny Dangerously falls completely in the hit or miss category with it's overblown gags and complete lack of a comprehensive script or story that makes ANY sense
17151,One of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's a movie that should be watched closely; some of the funny bits are done in passing and do not have the usual amount of attention drawn to them.
17152,"One of Michael Keaton's best. He is 'on' throughout the film. With co-stars like Ms. Henner, Joe Piscopo and Danny DeVito, you can't go wrong. Great laughs, great"
17153,"A Must See for Entomology Students and Teachers! I wish it was available on DVD, so that I could watch it again and show others. brbrI wish it was available on DVD, so that I could watch"
17154,"I agree whole-heartedly with the comments so far. I remember this documentary as being one of the most amazing and informative I've ever seen. This should be required watching for anybody, but especially the schools."
17155,One of the best documentaries I've ever seen. I've seen it many times. I've seen it many times. I love it.
17156,"An important film, dealing with the dark side of female sexuality. It flirts with sadomasochism and the captive falling in love with captor theory."
17157,"One of the best mainstream films of all time, but why isn't it available on pay cable? It's just too politically incorrect for today's audience."
17158,"""Love Crimes"" is at its best when Sean Young is playing her cat-and-mouse game with Bergin. It's unfortunate that the film doesn't end, it just stops."""
17159,"""Love in the Time of Money"" is a visually stunning film to watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people"
17160,"What do you call 100 film critics? (Answer) A good start. Well, I don't know Peter Mattei from Adam but if he is the budding auteur his filmography suggests, ""Love in the Time of Money"
17161,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time........"
17162,"Is there a connection between ""Love"" and ""Closer's"" ""Closer"" scene? Is it a coincidence or is it just a coincidence?"
17163,"A rare film that treats its characters so honestly and compassionately. LOVED IT! Great cast with notable performances by Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, and her love interest (forgot his name!)"
17164,Terrific film with a slightly slow start - give it a chance to get cooking. Story builds in interest and complexity. Characters and story line subvert expectation and cliche at all the right moments.
17165,One of the best films I've seen at the Tribeca Film Festival                 
17166,One of the best indie films I've seen in a long time...and I'm not just saying that because it's a Judd Hirsch film.
17167,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time!"
17168,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time........"
17169,What percentage of movies does a person go to see these days that leave them wondering what happened to their eight to ten dollars? ANSWER: TOO MANY!
17170,"One of the most interesting films I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it's a Jewish/twins/family film."
17171,Brother's Shadow is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. It's a great family portrait. Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are great as father and son.
17172,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
17173,A well-thought-out 'caper movie' which captures the feel of late '60s 'big iron' business computing quite well. Ustinov and Smith are very convincing as the two misfits stumbling into love.
17174,Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith are the best of the best in the movie world.......
17175,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time."
17176,"Very funny, romantic, intelligent, and ahead-of-its-time picture. To tell you how would spoil this very funny, romantic, intelligent, and ahead-of-its-time picture."
17177,"Ustinov, Maggie Smith, Bob Newhart, and Karl Malden all have a lot of fun in this movie. It's very sly for all of the 60's look to the movie."
17178,"""O Nolo Mio"" is the best movie I've seen in a long, long time. I've seen it over and over again."
17179,"""Hot Millions"" is a delightful comedy that is made even better by the presence of the marvelous cast assembled for it. The movie is a tribute to the genius of Peter Ustinov, who wrote the screen play and appears as the key"
17180,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
17181,"One of Ustinov's best and most entertaining..well, I'll give it a shot..well, I'll give it a shot.."
17182,"It's a delightful film, with a feelgood factor that it achieves without crossing the line into soppy sentimentality. Naturally sweet - no added sugar."
17183,"""Hot Millions"" is a well-written, well-acted tale about an embezzler who steals (whoops! -- too low class a word for an embezzler, according to Peter Ustinov's lead character) a """

17186,"Hot Millions is a great movie in every way. A fun, offbeat story with wonderful performances by four of the best professionals ever to work in the business. Peter Ustinov is brilliant, as usual, and Maggie Smith is a total delight"
17187,"A clever, undeniably entertaining romp starring Peter Ustinov as a career embezzler with his sights set on a US conglomerate in London. He's abetted by foxy (and deceptively sharp) Maggie Smith and threatened with exposure by"
17188,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, but it's not quite as good as I thought it would be. It's a little confusing at the end."
17189,"""I never agonize over decisions"" -- Bob Newhart's best role in this part.<n>""I never agonize over decisions"" -- Maggie Smith is pretty, sexy, and turns out to be not nearly"
17190,This is a rip-roaring British comedy movie and one that i could watch over and over again without growing tired. Peter Ustinov has never performed in a bad role and this is no exception.
17191,"I think this movie is well done and realistic. I you are used to watching Hollywood ""action"" movies, and use that as a standard to rate this movie, you are bound to be disappointed. This movie is much closer to real life"
17192,"Not the best movie ever but a good one for the Swedish market. I did not set very high expectations for this movie, which left me pleasantly surprised. The story is a little strange sometimes but overall I think it has an acceptable credibility."
17193,"Nice Gripen and Hkp 9 (MBB Bo 105) flight scenes in this movie. One of the few disappointments was the EWS 39 jammer pod, in this case an inert Rb 75 (Maverick) missile painted"
17194,What Is It? What Is It? What Is It? What Is It? What Is It? What Is It? What Is It?
17195,"Hilarious, evocative, confusing, brilliant film. Reminds me of Bunuel's L'Age D'Or or Jodorowsky's Holy Mountain-- lots of strange characters mucking about and looking for....."
17196,"One of Crispin Glover's best films, but it's not what you'd expect......"
17197,"I really like this guy, he is just so bizarre I can't help it. Note: I saw this film before it was through its final editing, so maybe what I have seen and what others have seen are different."
17198,This film is very interesting. I have seen it twice and it seems Glover hit the nail on the head with what he claims to he wants to accomplish.

17202,"This is the best movie I've seen in a long time : it's all there : the city, the relationships, the mess, the utopian mindsets in the most light-hearted, blithe and oblivious me"
17203,One of the best movies i've seen in the last 2 years!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

17206,THE BUBBLE ('Ha-Buah') is a fine film about the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian territories. It is a window into a situation that begs for understanding.
17207,"Tel-Aviv is Tel-Aviv, Tel-Aviv is Tel-Aviv. Tel-Aviv is Tel-Aviv. Tel-Aviv is Tel-Aviv."
17208,"The bubble of the title is the world apart in which the leading man, Noam, played by the Fox regular Ohad Knoller (Yossi in YOSSI & JAGGER)"
17209,"This film is a complete re-imagining of Romeo and Juliet in Tel Aviv and Nablus. The lovers are one from Tel Aviv et the other from Nablus. There is a border between them, and a constant state of war with the"
17210,"One more beauty in the string of beautiful films directed by Eytan Fox. The movie presents the story of star-crossed lovers (one Israeli, one Palestinian)in modern Tel Aviv."
17211,"Another fine romantic drama in which we must deal with tragedy and celebrate the beauty and joy in life. Westerners, especially urban gay men like myself, need to be moved outside our safety zone and be informed of the real life and death struggle elsewhere"
17212,"This is a very good movie. It has heart, and heartbreak. And like all good love stories love does win out. But not in it's intact glory of full bloom. Still, it's a very satisfying movie to watch"
17213,"This is the second Eytan Fox film I have seen. The real stars are the young Israelis who live together in a tiny apartment - Noam (Ohad Knoller), Lulu (Daniela Virtzer), and Yelli (Alon"

17216,"Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"" is performed in a Kentucky Correctional Prison........."
17217,"Shakespeare Behind Bars was a strangely uplifting documentary despite its content. Convicts at Luther Luckett Correctional Complex in LaGrange, Kentucky who have raped, murdered etc and surrounded by bad people in an obviously depressing environment find something they genuinely enjoy and can become"
17218,"Shakespeare Behind Bars is one of the best films I've seen in a long, long time......"
17219,"I liked this movie, even if I'm the oldest of Gadget's fans. =P.............."
17220,"It's a light teen dramedy, but you'll find it likeable. Unless you're an old coot, you'll probably find it likeable. It isn't so good on developing characters or situations"
17221,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and it's not just for kids. It's for the whole family."
17222,"One of the best teen films I've seen in a long time, but it's ignored by the media. It's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."

17227,"""Seven Minutes in Heaven"" is based on a game played by my husband's friends in junior high school.<n>The game was popular among my husband's friends when he was in junior high."
17228,I think that people are under estimating this incredible film. People are seeing it as a typical horror movie that is set out to scare us and prevent us from getting some sleep. Which if it was trying to do then it would deservedly get a
17229,"One of the better ""reunuin"" TV specials of the late 1970s/early 1980s. Yvonne De Carlo was the better choice over Joan Marshall."
17230,"One of the cheesiest plots I have ever seen! Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis are very good at what they achieved in the original Munsters series. I wish Yvonne De Carlo, as Lily, would have had more plot involvement."
17231,You'll laugh out loud just like I did. You'll laugh out loud just like I did. You'll laugh out loud just like I did.
17232,One of Jackie Chan's finest works. It should provide a nice start for any potential Jackie fans. The bad news for anyone who sees this first is that Jackie Chan movies don't come much better.
17233,One of the best Jackie Chan movies ever made! brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
17234,"Probably Jackie Chan's best film in the 1980s, and the one that put him on the map. The scale is evident from the opening and closing scenes, during which a squatters' village and shopping mall are demolished."
17235,One of Jackie Chan's most impressive efforts in the 80s.........
17236,"Not quite a blend of Wodehouse and Hollywood, but close enough. Some of the American vaudeville humour, the slapstick not the witty banter, clash with Wodehouse's British sense of humour."
17237,"Not as good as Wodehouse's novel, but not as bad as it could have been......"
17238,"Joan Fontaine is ""A Damsel in Distress"" in this 1937 musical starring Fred Astaire, George Burns, and Gracie Allen. The best scene is the ""Stiff Upper Lip"" number, which takes place in a fun house."
17239,"A Damsel in Distress is a delight because of the great Gershwin songs, Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine, and a terrific supporting cast headed by Gracie Allen and George Burns."
17240,"A Damsel in Distress is a classic, classic score, classic dancing, classic comedy. Who could ask for anything more? A Damsel in Distress rates as a classic, classic score, classic dancing, classic comedy. Who could ask for"
17241,"""Damsel"" is a Gershwin swinger, but it's not as good as ""Nice Work If You Can Get It"" & ""Stiff Upper Lip"""
17242,"It's a Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers film, but it's not as good as I thought it would be--and it's not as good as I thought it would be!"
17243,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it many times and still enjoy it.....
17244,"Askey steals the show, but it's not quite as good as he'd like it to be....."
17245,"One of Arthur Askey's best. A bit spooky, but still fun to watch. A bit of a classic. A bit of Askey at his best."
17246,One of the best black and white movies I have seen in a long time. I love it. I can't wait to see it on DVD!
17247,"One of Jack Hulbert's Best, but it's not quite as good as you'd expect......"
17248,"Ghost Train is a fine and entertaining film, typical of the better British comedy chillers of the 1930s and 40s. The antics of comedian Arthur Askey are not as funny as they once apparently were, but this can be overcome by"
17249,"The Ghost Train is a genuine British war time classic! Arthur Askey entertains you and I suspect the cast, to a high octane, thrills and spills, espionage thriller.It's set in old rural England during the second world"
17250,"The Ghost Train is a treat to those who appreciate the typical 1940's humour. It incorporates World War Two into the plot but not as much as I initially believed it would, and the characters are a unique blend who play their roles fairly"
17251,"Fun to watch, spooky atmospheric and effects were pretty good considering they were bang in the middle of World War Two. The plot did unravel pretty quickly at the end with the villains getting their comeuppance."
17252,One of Arthur Askey's best films and a must-see for anyone who loves him and the ghost of the train..<n>A must-see for anyone who loves the ghost of the train.
17253,A classic British comedy-thriller with a twist............
17254,A fine example of forties black and white comedy. Arthur Askey is a fine actor in this film. I am glad to have had the opportunity to watch another piece of work by Arnold Ridley (Private Godfrey in dad's army)
17255,"One of my favourite films first saw it when I was about 10, which probably tells you a lot about the type of humour. Although dated the humour definitely has a charm about it. Expect to see the usual Askey & Murdoch banter so"
17256,"One of those movies you would have to give 7.5 to. Askey does indeed come across as over the top, but it's a great vehicle for him, just as Oh, Mr Porter is for Will hay."
17257,"A film that is too damn good to be sunk by a single performance, even that of the lead actor. Personally, I love Askey, perhaps it's because I go into his world, rather than unreasonably expecting him to come into"
17258,Not as bad as I thought it would be -- and it's not as bad as I thought it would be -- but it's still entertaining and atmospheric and worth waiting for its next appearance.
17259,"One of Askey's best, but it's not a ""classic"" horror flick...or a ""classic"" thriller...it's just Askey!"
17260,"a timeless classic, wonderfully acted with perfect location settings, conjuring a marvelous atmospheric movie. i wish that a video was available in Britain. i have seen this film on many occasions and it remains one of my favorites along with Oh Mr Porter"
17261,"One of the best Black & White movies I've seen in a long, long time......."
17262,"""Siberiade"" is the best film I've ever seen in my life! I can't wait for Andron to release it on DVD!"
17263,"""Sibiriada"" is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. I liked it very much. I would prefer ""Kurochka Ryaba"" to ""Tango and Cash"""
17264,"This movie is not action packed, it flowes slowely. In second part one can find great songs - Russian romances. It is much more better than Doctor Zhivago."
17265,One of the best Soviet films of the 20th Century. A must-see for all Soviet history enthusiasts. A must-see for anyone who wishes to get an impression of the Soviet view of modern Russian history.
17266,"""It can't matter"", seems like the world is saying, to which Konchalovksy answers ""it must matter"" because the protagonists keep on trying for redemption"
17267,"""The Young Victoria"" tries to balance the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign. It has redressed the rare distinction of being produced by a former Royal, Sarah Duchess of York."
17268,"It's actually better than I expected it to be, and I found myself really enjoying it. I don't know too much about Queen Victoria beyond what most know - married to Albert, who died young, and she mourned him ever"
17269,"A warm, touching story of real love in these cynical times. Many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes. You really believe that the young Victoria and Albert are passionately fond of each other."
17270,"The Young Victoria is one of the best period dramas of the past few years, and one of Jean-Marc Vallée's best films to date."
17271,Rupert Friend is superb as Prince Albert. He is superb in this film. Emily Blunt is good but I didn't believe for a minute she was Victoria. No real sense of period. It may no have been her fault but her prince
17272,"A great historical/biographic movie, with a great performance by Emily Blunt as Queen Victoria! brbr br br br br br br br br"
17273,"""The Young Victoria"" is a good film, but it needs to be longer and more detailed. It's too compressed to be understood by a person without historical knowledge of Queen Victoria."
17274,"Young Victoria is a beautiful film, made even better by Emily Blunt's performance as the young queen.<n>The film is beautifully shot, costumed, and set, making it a visual treat in every way."
17275,"A lite-version of the young queen's life, but not without a few moments of political intrigue.<n>A must-see for those interested in Kings and Queens in the British Monarchy"
17276,"Not as full a performance as I'd like, no blame to her. I can't help but feel like this is a Mills & Boon novel adaptation compared to a darker, more dramatic movie about another young queen, Elizabeth."
17277,One of the best films I've seen in a long time - and Emily Blunt is the star here.....
17278,"One of those beautifully intense movies that draws us so intimately far in. Than were left looking at the screen like, ""No they didn't!"", lol. I knew she would give a solid, convincing performance catching young Victoria's"
17279,What more can you ask for in a film about a young woman's life and love of a man who will change the course of the world for the better?
17280,"A very nice movie, but it could have been a little more exciting. I don't know, I wanted'something' to happen that would have Victoria draw out some strength and prove her worth a little more."
17281,"The Young Victoria is one of the best period films I've seen in a long time, and I'm not just saying that because I liked it."
17282,"The Young Victoria is a beautiful film and has presented Queen Victoria in a different light to what everyone thinks about her. The films wipes away the ""I am not amused"" impression of Queen Victoria and shows she was a cheerful young woman."
17283,"Enjoyed the movie very much. Certainly will leave the audience wanting to know more, and there is truly a lot more historically to find out!brbr"
17284,One of the best films I've seen in a long time! brbr br br br br br br br br br 
17285,One of the best films ever made about the life of a young Queen Victoria.........
17286,"""The Young Victoria"" is a beautifully photographed,brilliantly-scored and very sumptuous movie.I note that it has been criticised in some quarters for this sumptuousness as if a movie about 19th century English Royalty should somehow have shown"
17287,"Very well done, but not as accurate as I would have liked. I don't think it's a great film, but it's a good one."
17288,'The Young Victoria' chronicles the young Queen's romance with her husband-to-be but also does a pretty good job of detailing the political machinations surrounding her ascent to the throne.
17289,"""The Young Victoria"" is a lovely entry in a year that has shown much emphasis on war and destruction. In the end, the movie is a lovely entry in a year that has shown much emphasis on war and destruction."
17290,One of the best films about the British Monarchy I've seen in a long time..and one of the best films I've seen in a long time.
17291,"Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend are a fine pair in this adaptation of Julian Fellowes' biography of the young queen of England's Royalties. A solid film that benefits from some fine settings, solid direction by Jean-Marc Vallée."
17292,One of the best movies of the year! One of the best movies I've seen in a long time! One of the best movies I've seen in a long time!
17293,A new side to the story of Victoria and Albert is brought to life by director Jean-Marc Valle. Emily Blunt is more than capable in the title role as she gives audiences a different perspective.
17294,A great movie about the early years of Victoria with a great performance from Emily Blunt.<n>A great movie about the early years of Victoria with a Great performance from Emily Blunt.
17295,"An engrossing film, thank god no kiera knightley in it, refreshing and it gives us all a genuine insight into the difficult life of Queen Victoria and the difficult choices she had to make"
17296,"Pretty, but not quite as good as you'd expect from a film based on the life of a British monarch.<n>The development of Victoria's relationship with Prince Albert is interesting, but not as good as you'd expect"
17297,"One of the true ""Twilight Zone"" classics, but not one of the best, but still entertaining......"
17298,"I remember this with my whole family as a 9 year old in 1964 on our black and white TV. I vividly remember the scene when Adam finds Eve, her eyes were blackened."
17299,What I wasn't expecting was an allegory for the trials of human existence. Leave it to Lynch to take a simple story about a 300 mile trip on a lawnmower and turn it into a microcosm for the human condition.
17300,The power of film to introduce you to some precious part of yourself. And then giving yourself some time for the next little while simply listening to its echoes in the small hours of the night.
17301,A warm movie. Not excessively sentimental. Not excessively sentimental. A warm movie. Not excessively sentimental. A warm movie. Not excessively sentimental. A warm movie. Not excessively sentimental. A warm movie. Not excessively sentimental. A warm movie.
17302,"One of the most moving films I've ever seen. It's a loving story about family, friendship, and the kindness of strangers. I would highly recommend it."
17303,"""A truly nice story with a moral about brotherly love"" describes this odd David Lynch film. This was especially ""odd"" because it wasn't the kind of film Lynch had been putting out in the last 15 -20 years."
17304,"An honest movie, not a saccharine one..........."
17305,"It takes patience to get through David Lynch's eccentric, but-- for a change-- life-affirming chronicle of Alvin Straight's journey, but stick with it"
17306,I feel like I know just a little bit more about the USA. After seeing this film I feel like I know just a little bit more about the USA.
17307,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once.
17308,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and I'm not just saying that because it's a David Lynch movie..."
17309,"One of the few live action films that I can think of that features a G rating. Incredibly significant, this films stands as evidence that beautiful and significant family films can be produced."
17310,"One of the best films of the 1990's, and one of the best of the 2000's, by David Lynch, Richard Farnsworth, Sissy Spacek, and John Roach."
17311,One of the greatest films I have ever seen. I glowed inside throughout the whole film. The music and cinematography held the spell when little was happening on screen.
17312,"Richard Farnsworth at his best in his last film. It was his last film and his performance was amazing. You can't help but to understand his pride, his wisdom, and to ultimately feel his pain."
17313,One of the best Lynch films I've seen in a long time.........
17314,One of the best Lynch films I've ever seen...........
17315,"Sissy Spacek and David Lynch at their best in one of their best films. One of the best unless you like car chases, sex scenes, and violence. One of the best unless you like car chases, sex scenes,"
17316,One of Richard Farnworth's best roles...and it's not just about the lawnmower ride. It's about a man's heart.
17317,One of Lynch's best films..but it's a little slow..but it's the story of an old man's 6-week(that's my best guess for its duration) journey.
17318,"MULHOLLAND DRIVE made me the definitive fan of David Lynch. He's a modern genius, because he's not only a film-maker. His stories and his style have a spell that cross the screen. So THE "
17319,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time........"
17320,"The real power behind ""The Straight Story"" is its charm and its intelligence.<n>""The Straight Story"" is the rare live-action ""G""-rated movie that truly should not be missed."
17321,One of Lynch's best films...and it's not just for the faint of heart...it's for the faint of heart...and it's not just for the faint of heart.
17322,"The most personal of David Lynch's works is his most accessible. This time, rather than the enigmatic thematic structures that may or may not involve a plot or..."
17323,"Not much of Lynch's bizzare style, but there is enough of quirky characters to make the film amusing. The movie kept my interest so much that I didn't even know the sun was about to rise."
17324,"The only way to watch this very good movie, which rates a 7/10 in my book. It's the only way to watch this very good movie, which rates a 7/10 in my book."
17325,One of the best movies I've ever seen. I'm glad it's David Lynch's work. I'm glad it's so pure and beautiful.
17326,"One of those films that you see smiling and you do not know why. Well, one of the reasons could be that we are before one of the most surprising directors today, and he is able to film emotions."
17327,The most touching and uplifting movie I've ever seen! brbr br br br br br br br br br br 
17328,"One of the best films of the 20th century, and one of the best of the 20th century. Richard Farnsworth's last performance as a leading man."
17329,The only show I have watched since 90210! Why did they discontinue it? It was the only show that captured the essence of Hawaii and made you feel like you are a part of it all!
17330,"I Really Do Enjoy Watching This. Zillion Times Better Than Expected.Recommendation: I Really Do Enjoy Watching This. Please Rate My Review After Reading It, Thanks."
17331,it was the best show ever!!!!!! i really want to know what would have happened between jason and nicole... maybe they could make a spin off!!
17332,I don't see how this show is like the OC at all. brbrI hope Fox keeps it on the air. brbrI think this is a great show with good actors for the most part
17333,"A very strange film, but must be seen by all viewers - if the are good catholiques it is mandatory - because it is a very rare jewell in film history"
17334,This movie is about the cruel dilemma between a life dedicated to God and faith and a life of more earthly pleasures. In post war France it is also about the mortal aspect of Faith itself.
17335,Fresnay's performance is the best in the history of French cinema                 
17336,"Interesting, even with all its faults and the zombie acting of some of the actors. I found that the experiments interesting and the hardware realistic. I will note that this experiments are in a very early stage, with results so far not favorable."
17337,"A very good Babylon 5 movie, with some exceptional performances from Martin Sheen, Tracy Scoggins and Ian MacShane. If this were an episode of the series (without the humour) it would probably be one of my favourite stand-alone"
17338,An excellent film with great performances from Zack & Lochley. Much to their displeasure (& mine) Garibaldi arrived on station. It doesn't take him long to start criticizing Zack (who I love best of all on the show)and
17339,"Better than ""Thirdspace"" but not as good as ""In the Beginning"" as far as the B5 movies go. I really think the television series did a much better job overall with the special effects and character portrayal."
17340,"Nifty little episode played mainly for laughs, but with clever dollop of suspense. Makes for a very entertaining half-hour even if the action is confined to a single set."
17341,"""Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?"" is one of the best episodes of this great series. The intriguing story has ironic and witty dialogs, funny characters and situations and a surprising and totally unexpected plot point in the very end."
17342,"Rod Serling's ""Housewife"" sluts ala Eva Longoria or Terri Hatcher, or the pitiful stabs at humor and witty banter that litter our high-tech screens"
17343,"One of the more adorable episodes of the Twilight Zone, with some fun dialog and amusing characters to break the tension of some creepy moments. Jack Elam's ""old man"" steals the show."
17344,"A fun, low-brow Twilight Zone episode that's funny and watchable...but don't be fooled by the plot...it's not all that bad!"
17345,"One of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes. And the next day we were in the supermarket at Hollywood Blvd. and La Brea, my father and I, and guess who was coming toward us in the..."
17346,"One of my all-time favorite Twilight Zone episodes, and it's not just because it's the only Twilight Zone episode with a double snapper ending."
17347,"A fairy tale that diverts and amuses. It's not a moral message about pod people masquerading as normal citizens. It's not a warning of any kind, just a fairy tale that diverts and amuses."
17348,"One of the best Jet Li movies I've ever seen, and I'm not talking about Cradle 2 The Grave, or Cradle 2 The Grave!"
17349,"Jet Li vs. Bruce Lee in Black Mask is one of the best films I have seen in a long, long time. This is one of the best films I have seen in a long time."
17350,"This is a good movie, but don't watch it for the story line. It's a mindless action film. It's a good movie, but don't watch it for the story line."
17351,"It's not about the story, it's about the fight scenes. It's entertaining and suspenseful enough to make room for that. Who needs a story with fighting like that? Really, it's worth watching for that reason"
17352,"One of the best action movies I've seen in a long, long time........"
17353,"Gory, but not as bad as some people think it will be........."
17354,"Black Mask isn't great, but it's not terrible either. The final fight sequence is well staged by Yuen Woo Ping. But the English release suffers from rough editing and dubbing. (I'm begging the Hollywood studios to"
17355,Jet Li is the greatest martial-arts star alive! Jet Li is the greatest martial-arts star alive! Jet Li is the greatest martial-arts star alive!
17356,"Not the best of the HK films, but still fun to watch........."
17357,One of the best action films I've seen in a long time. It's one of the best I've seen in a long time.
17358,"What more could I say? The Americans totally hated it because the U.S. cut was so bad, although you could detect the underlying goodwill in it."
17359,It's not a perfect movie by any means but I disagree with the overall IMDb opinion that it's really bad. I watched a lot of Hong Kong flix in the 1990's and loved the era dearly.
17360,Very good martial arts film and Jet Li is the best since the master himself Bruce Lee.Li is excellent as the low key librarian/cop who saves all time and time again
17361,"This movie is MY FAVORITE MOVIE!!! This movie has excellent combat fighting. This movie does sound like a silly story line about how Jet Li plays a super hero, like Spider-Man, or etc. But once you've seen this movie"
17362,One of the best martial arts movies I've seen in a long time........
17363,One of the best action movies I've seen in a long time.........
17364,"One of the best pre-code films of the 1930s, and it's hard to find it in the U.S., but it's worth it."
17365,"Tough-minded, well-structured and -realized move about denizens of a New York City shantytown. They're grifters, beggars, and women forced into prostitution, but they're a community of people both good"
17366,"One of the best Pre-Code films I've seen in a long, long time - and I've seen it many, many times too!"
17367,Man's Castle is a great film about the Great Depression of the 1930's and its effects on women as well as men. Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young are the stars.
17368,"Lensman was the first Animated motion picture to use hand drawn and CG animation all at once. If it were not for Lensman, none of that would have ever happened (personally, I think Computer Graphics look better in animation that live action"
17369,"Lensman is a rather lesser-known Anime gem from Toho and MK studios.It's loosely based on the novel,but it reminds me more of the game ""Metroid"""
17370,One of the best westerns of the 80's - if not the best sci-fi film of the 90's.....
17371,"""Secret of the Lens"" is perhaps a pretty campy all-time favorite of mine. The best and funniest from Kajawari Yoshiaki, who is known for splatter anime and sleazy hentai-ecchi anime"
17372,"One of the Studio's best short subjects, but not as good as the studio's full-length feature films............"
17373,"I love these ""Diaper Baby"" movies! You couldn't make a movie like this today and it is rich in cinematic history. It is goofy and the film was made to make you laugh, which it does."
17374,A rare look at how our society has changed since the days of Shirley Temple's and the children's films of the 60's and 70's.
17375,It's just a movie and it's not pornographic. I acquired this short film from my parents 30 years ago and have always been totally delighted with it. I've shown it to many of my friends & they all loved it
17376,I don't understand the kiddie-porn that is being claimed. It is just a cute little film. I have seen family shows that I grew up watching in the '80's and '90's that had little girls dressed more provocative
17377,"A nice Shirely Temple short. Perhaps being ""seen and not heard"" needed to be made up for. A fun way to kill ten minutes while you're waiting for your good night glass of milk to warm up on the stove."
17378,"The best educational film I've seen in a long time, but it's not for the faint of heart. It's not for the faint of heart."
17379,HEMO THE MAGNIFICENT - A Frank Capra WONDERS OF LIFE FILM                
17380,It's been a long time since I saw this. Probably about 18 years ago?brbrThe movie tells us (kids) all about human blood and the circulatory system. Very professionally put together--Disney-style animation
17381,"Hemo (blood) as a Greek god was so well played by the animation with vanity, arrogance, snobbish superiority and innocent wonder. The quote (or scene) I recall vividly is when Hemo tires of ""all this plumbing"
17382,"I remember watching this is its original airing in 1962 as a five or six year old and REALLY enjoying this. I recently had the opportunity to watch it again,..."
17383,LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. Benot Poelvoorde is brilliant.
17384,"Benot Poelvoorde is on fine form as Roger, the angry, obsessive father of a family in a small Belgian mining town. Roger is a photographer who, along with his young daughter Luise, visits road accidents to"
17385,"Good humour and optimism to overcome the bleakness of some critics' view of this film. For me, the quietly positive and stoic character of the daughter is the still centre of the film, often counterbalancing the unhappy aspects of the setting and"
17386,"LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDANT - A ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS meets LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDANT - a Surreal, Surreal, Surreal, Surreal, Surreal, Surreal, Surreal,"
17387,Diego Armando Maradona is the greatest footballer in the history of football..and still is..and still is..and still is..and still is.
17388,"This movie is a must for all people that enjoy soccer as an art. The audience, the referees, the journalists covering the matches and the environment itself all play a central role in the development of what today is history."
17389,"Maradona is the hero of this story, a one-man World Cup winning machine. In 1982 hundreds of young men had died in a pointless battle for the Falkland Isles; now the British press yearned for a rematch (with the"
17390,One of the 2 best football films I have ever seen. One of the 2 best football films I have ever watched. One of the 2 best. One of the 2 best.
17391,I really love this show! I have always liked the 1990's shows of Space Ghost! This show was hilarious and I can't believe why Cartoon Network's Adult Swim would take such a funny show like this off the air
17392,Braik and Zorak are living their lives outside of Spac Ghost Coast To Coast. Leave it to Braik to put on a good show. Finally he and Zorak are living their own lives outside of Spac Ghost Coast To Coast
17393,"""The Brak Show "" is good.Probably not in the same level as ""Aqua Teen Hunger "" or ""Space Ghost Coast to Coast "", but definitely it have many brilliant moments """
17394,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
17395,A little ray of sunshine in a dark season. It celebrates a quality best described as plain old friendliness. Morgan Freeman plays a character very like Freeman himself--a successful actor pushing 70.
17396,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman."
17397,I'm a cynic. I like my endings sad and my hankies dry. I didn't cry when Bambi's mother was shot. Basically I was born without an artistic soul.
17398,"One of those little films about human relationships where being vulnerable to change and exchange is the message. It is well worth viewing, and this is a DVD that has featurettes that are touching, informative, and comic - a pleasure to view."
17399,This is the best movie i've seen in a long time!brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
17400,"What about just being entertained? Something at which Morgan Freeman excels. Paz Vega, his co-star, gets a career boost and Brad Silberling gets a name to draw people into watching his movie."
17401,"A great, funny, sweet movie with Morgan Freeman (who plays himself) and who meets a Spanish girl named Scarlet (Paz Vega) at a small store whilst researching a potential independent film"
17402,"A small, overlooked 2006 dramedy that works very well within its limitations. Running only seventy-two minutes, this small, overlooked 2006 dramedy is really just a two-character sketch piece but one that works very well within its"
17403,"Not as good as it could have been, but Morgan Freeman is still good in this one........."
17404,One of the best indie films I've seen in a long time...and I'm not just saying that because it's a Morgan Freeman movie.
17405,One of the best independent films I've seen in a long time...and it's not just because it's so short. It's because it's so good.
17406,"One of those 'under the radar' pictures that's drenched in the simplicity that most independent movies have. The great thing is, this entire movie looks improbable despite its 'road movie' roots."
17407,"An odd little film that makes you think about your own life, and the world you live in. A nice watch. A.k.a. ""Him"" and a.k.a. Paz Vega."
17408,"It all comes down to loving people. As Will Rogers said, ""I never met a man I didn't like."" Of course, if you meet Paz Vega, what's not to like?"
17409,"Morgan Freeman is a 'good fit' for this film, and he is not only believable, but he gets a chance to change his image of playing a character with reserved dignity and propriety."
17410,"""10 Items or Less"" is not perfect but it doesn't do anything wrong. I recommend this movie and call it beautiful and delightful admitting it's not perfect but it doesn't do anything wrong."
17411,"Don't think you can't have a better life, don't think you can't have all you can in life, don't think you can't have all you can in life, don't think you"
17412,"This is film-making at it's simplest and it's best.brbrI had my doubts, because even though Freeman is great actor, sometimes he gets involved in bad projects; this is not one of those times"
17413,"I was lost at the beginning, but then I realized I was enjoying this movie. It's truly funny watching ""him"" (for that's how the character is identified in the credits) be overwhelmed by a visit to the local"
17414,"This is a good movie, not a bad one, but not the standard Hollywood formula. I think it worked well, I am purposely trying to avoid any direct references to the movie because seeing it for yourself is the best answer, not accepting"
17415,"Charming, funny, and well written. It seems that Morgan Freeman surely have fun at the set. Also good music. Paz Vega is a beautiful and smart woman."
17416,"Not great, but it is a good and enjoyable one. Morgan Freeman basically plays himself, although the director swears the script was not written for him. And there is the small irony of the actor that goes in a supermarket to do research"
17417,"One of the best noir films of the late 60's, and one of the best of the early 70's too......"
17418,"One of Jack Palance's best films, a must-see for any sci-fi/thriller fan......."
17419,"One of Elia Kazan's best, but it's a bit over-sized and over-acted.<n>Kazan's best work is A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), East of Eden (1955) and East of"
17420,"""Panic in the Streets"" is still effective and with a great villain. Jack Palance performs a despicable scum in his debut, and the camera work while he tries to escape with Zero Mostel is still very impressive."
17421,"Elia Kazan's ""Panic in the Streets"" is a great movie to watch. But it drags a little at some points. ""Panic in the Streets"" remains a perfectly watchable movie."
17422,Refreshing lost' gem! Featuring effective dialog combined with excellent acting to establish the characters and involve you enough to care what happens to them. The Douglas and Widmark characters are realistic heroes. Palance is his usual evil presence.
17423,One of the best films I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more than once......
17424,One of the lesser-celebrated films of the great Elia Kazan.<n>The acting is marvelous and the dialogue sharp if the story isn't quite up to the direction and performances.
17425,"""Panic in the Streets"" was a decent thriller, but I felt a bit disappointed by it. The central theme of a city being attacked by a plague in modern times is fascinating. Its well made and entertaining, but its not as interesting"
17426,"It's a good movie, but there's nothing sinister about it. I can't really condemn it because it does work. There is enough film noir elements to consider it a noir movie, but I think it's only"
17427,"'Panic in the Streets' is quite the rewarding watch, nonetheless. Nearly everyone involved here has done better work, 'Panic in the Streets' is quite the rewarding watch, nonetheless. Especially for the film-noir enthusiast"
17428,"Just a comment on New Orleans accents...brbrAn earlier reviewer noted the following: ""This film... presents us with characters that speak more like ""broklynese"" than maybe a Southern accent one might hear in that part"
17429,"Elia Kazan's ""Panic in the Streets"" and ""On the Waterfront"" are different visions about different subjects, for they are different.<n>The film is enjoyable thanks to Mr. Kazan's direction and the excellent cast working"
17430,One of the best New Orleans noirs I've ever seen - and it's free on the Internet Archive.........
17431,"An effective, and classy, little thriller directed by Elia Kazan that blends documentary realism with a race against time pulpy heartbeat. Panic In The Streets is taken from the story Quarantine, Some Like 'em Cold by Edna and Edward An"
17432,"An exciting and atmospheric thriller in which director Elia Kazan achieved a great sense of realism by shooting the movie in New Orleans, using a number of local people to fill various roles and making intelligent use of improvisation."
17433,"Palance, Mostel, Widmark, &amp; Douglas add color to a thriller that's already well-staged......"
17434,Like A Streetcar Named Desire (also directed by Gadg both on stage and screen) Panic In The Streets depicts a New Orleans in which its major claim to fame - the birthplace of Jazz - doesn't even rate a mention
17435,"Not really, but this is a very good film indeed, and is sadly a forgotten gem. Black and white suits the film. Sadly. Jack Palance went on to play similar characters in some really second rate gangster or war movies."
17436,"One of the best film noirs I've ever seen, but don't expect it to be as good as the Oscar-winning Kazan's"
17437,The Pneumonic Plague of the 1950's--but it's not as bad as you'd think!.....
17438,"Kazan's 'Panic in the Streets' is pure melodrama, of the best kind.<n>Kazan's film is the first (that I know of) to approach the subject of biological epidemics."

17443,"One of America's most brilliant film directors was without question Elia Kazan. His directorial genius was not particularly suited to taut thrillers, since Kazan needed more room to breathe and to be..."
17444,"One of the best pseudo noir films I've seen in a long, long time. I've seen it more times than I care to remember."
17445,"Very good movie crackles with tension. The commentary is superb. Watch it once to enjoy the film on its own. If you are interested in film-making, a second time with the commentary on to learn."
17446,"One of the few films to do justice to this city, and a good film to boot. I'll make an exception for ""Tightrope"", which almost got it right."
17447,"Martin's Day is the BEST movie I have ever seen in my life! I am, without a doubt, the biggest fan of this movie EVER!"
17448,"An imaginative tale of a man and a boy under less than ideal conditions.<n>A well-made and imaginative production, refreshingly free from cliché."
17449,"A good movie to watch when you don't want to do a lot of thinking, just want to be told a simple story. The Canadian scenery was breathtaking."
17450,"""An album of songs so old everyone thinks they're new."" This film has the elusive combination of pace and mood that set some films apart from the opening moments"

17452,"An all-star cast of over-the-hill actresses make this an unforgettable experience. All I can say is, I hope I look as good at their age!"
17453,"A wonderful, nostalgic, historical, sentimental, multi-generational entertainment that is seriously fun. (The DVD is now out & worth owning because of the bonus features & Dolby Digital sound)"
17454,A refreshing antidote to some of the pretentious garbage being ground out by the studios. Of course ANYTHING with the incomparable Judi Dench is worth watching. And Cleo Laine's brilliant jazz singing is a bonus.
17455,"A quirky movie that the Brits do so well. Low budget, cameo type roles, well executed. The story is a little weak, a recently widowed Judi Dench decides to round up the ""blonde bombshells' a all (well"
17456,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I'm so glad I saw this one at the store. It left me smiling and ready to watch it again, which I did a couple more times before I turned"

17461,"What a wonderful time for music and dancing! My only complaint was that I was a little too young to go to the USO and nightclubs. Guess it sounds like I'm living in the past, (I do have wonderful memories)"
17462,This film was in one word amazing! I have only seen it twice and have been hunting it everywhere. A beautiful ensemble of older screen gems who still have that energy.

17468,It's a delightful little film full of wonderful actors and a wonderful story line. Too bad they don't tour out here...I'd go see them

17475,"One of Yoji Yamada's best films to date, and a must see for any Japanese fan of the director's Samurai Trilogy (The Twilight Samurai, The Hidden Blade, Love and Honor)"
17476,This movie is a huge statue erected in praise of the role of the mother in the history of mankind. Sayuri Yoshinaga is not less than sublime in the title role and it was a monumental scandal that she didn't get an Asian
17477,"I cried almost as much as with the Japanese film classic Twenty-Four Eyes (1954), I gave it a 10 out of 10 on the IMDb. Don't miss this film!"

17487,"This is an amazing movie, much better and more contemporary of his previous films, which are boring at this time, I think Kusturica is moving forward with this movie"
17488,"Disregard the plot and enjoy Fred Astaire doing A Foggy Day and several other dances, one a duo with a hapless Joan Fontaine. Here we see Astaire doing what are essentially ""stage"" dances in a purer form"
17489,"Fred Astaire, George Burns, and Graham Allen are the stars of the show.<n>Astaire's dance routine is the highlight of the film."
17490,"Not as good as the Astaire/Burns/Allen movies, but funhouse dance is worth more than most movies. Gracie Allen is great!"
17491,"P.G. Wodehouse's work is funny, but not as good as Evelyn Waugh's or Robert Surtees's novels."
17492,One of the best movies I've ever seen-and I've seen it over and over again. I'm still in love with it.

17497,Urban Cowboy is an accurate portrayal of life in urban Texas in the 60's and 70's. I thought the cast and crew did an excellent job. Scott Glenn should have received an Oscar for best supporting actor.

17503,This is my favorite movie of all time! SPOILER ALERT!                  
17504,What an overlooked 80's soundtrack. I imagine John Travolta sang some of the songs but in watching the movie it did seem to personify everything that was 80s cheese.
17505,"I remember it as a small kid and thinking it was the greatest movie ever. Now as an adult, I can look back and laugh and still feel sad, but this time I actually know what's going on"
17506,The best document of Texas life for the time period. Try and name a movie that depicts real life so vividly. Try and name a movie that depicts real life so vividly. They dont make them anymore.
17507,This is a smart drama about the way of life in a Texas honky tonk in the early 80's. John Travolta and Debra Winger turn in two very believable performances as Bud and Sissy Davis.
17508,"Another Travolta dance flick! GREAT MUSIC, mood, and scenes! Debra Winger is beautiful! Like ""Saturday Night Fever"" and almost begging him to have sex with them!"

17512,"Not as good as LITTLE MISS MARKER, but still a good movie for Shirley Jackson fans.<n>Cooper and Lombard are good and Shirley steals the scenes she's in."
17513,"""Now and Forever"" falls into the category of a Shirley vehicle without the standard Shirley story. It is an awkward position for any movie, but this impressive, talented cast makes it work."
17514,A very rare film from the early 30's. Shirley Temple is very good in it.Gary and Caroles edgy facial expressions when they are put under scrutiny are also very good.In all this is a good film from the early 30

17516,Patrick Swayze at his best in King's Solomon's Mines. A good movie for the entire family. Patrick once again plays a ruggedly handsome man who comes to the rescue of the damsel in distress.

17518,"A fine, thought-out version of the IJ saga, not a ""great parody"" or ""unintentional comedy"" as some have labeled it."
17519,Patrick Swayze is an excellent choice for Alan Quatermain's role in King Solomon's Mines. I enjoyed every minute of this movie. It was a big screen movie and not a made for TV movie.
17520,"Patrick Swayze as the hunter Alan Quartermaine and Richard Chamberlain as the ""Lady in Distress"" is a great portrayal of a man in his 50's and 60's"
17521,I loved this movie. Great storyline and actors and good movie sets. It told the story in a way I can easily understand and pay attention to without falling asleep. I would like to know where I could get the soundtrack.

17523,"This is a great film for the television, but it's a bit too long for my taste. I'd give it 8 out of 10."
17524,"Who the hell rests at night whilst walking in the desert and travels in the heat of the sun, and these people are supposed to be professional trackers/journeymen!!"
17525,"Patrick Swayze's first action film since ""RoadHouse"" but it's slow and not great. I wish he had done ""RoadHouse 2"" instead of ""King Solomon's Mines"""

17535,Kaakha Kaakha is a perfect cop film filled with right doses of action and romance.Even some Hollywood film cant compete with Kaakha Kaakha...undoubtedly.
17536,A well-made run-of-the-mill movie with a tragic ending. Pluses: The way the story moves - begins with Soorya struggling to live followed by a long flashback about why he's there.

17540,A wonderful movie based on a true man. Pierce Brosnan was very good as the English loner man who took on the persona of the half breed Grey Owl.
17541,GREY OWL is a very fine film -- worth checking out! I had a very warm feeling at the films conclusion -- and a whole new love and understanding for beavers!
17542,"An excellent movie, more like a book, that raises interesting questions about cultural identity and values. The key scene is Grey Owl admitting his imposture to Pony and her reaction."
17543,A wonderful movie based on the life of a man called Grey Owl in 1930s Canada. I found it to be similarly riveting and heartfelt as 'Rudy' and 'Awakenings'
17544,"Grey Owl - Pierce Brosnan's best role in his career, and the best movie of all time, in my opinion......."
17545,A biography of a very complex and extraordinary person. I liked the characters in the film and think that leaving parts of Archie's life a mystery captured his humanity.
17546,"A gentle, well-told tale and perfect for family viewing. Brosnan does a good job as the native American with a hidden past and the photography is stunning."
17547,"This film is wonderful in every way that modern action adventures are not. Take some time. Relax, enjoy. Think. People who see this movie as slow or plodding or dull really need to take a week off and watch it several times until"

17549,"If you know the story of Grey Owl, you'll love the movie! Annie Galipeau is a great actress, and Pierce is better than never in Grey Owl. But in this movie there's no real scene of action."
17550,"well worth watching, especially with the nice twist of a journalist with integrity, you are expecting a big fall down story line as Grey Owl is unmasked as a fraud, but it is not to be and adds to the generally optimistic and uplifting"

17559,An excellent movie. As a Canadian who grew up with a rural lifestyle much of it is familiar. It is easy to take the familiar for granted but after watching this film a few times it has grown on me.
17560,"Richard Attenborough's ""Grey Owl"" is a fascinating biography of a real-life Canadian writer of the 1920s and 1930s.<n>Pierce Brosnan's Grey Owl is a ""miscast"""

17600,Barbra Streisand's first television special. Must see viewing for any Streisand fan. Even non-Streisand fans will enjoy this highly energetic and entertaining piece of entertainment history. Performers like this only come our way once in a lifetime
17601,"What a brilliant performer Streisand WAS - BEFORE she achieved her goal of becoming a Movie Star. There had never been a female singer quite like her ever before, and there never would be again."
17602,Streisand at her purest and most eager to impress. As an investment. This is indeed the best of the bunch if only for the fact that this is Streisand at her purest and most eager to impress.
17603,Barbra Streisand's First Television Special is Still a Peaking Moment In Entertainment History - In Any Media - In Any Media - And It's On DVD!
17604,Barbra Streisand's first television special was simply fantastic! From her skit as a child to her medley of songs in a high-fashion department store -- everything was top-notch!
17605,"This is the best thing I've ever seen in my life, and I've seen it many times since. I can't believe it's been 42 years."

17609,"Aardman Animations at it's best, and it's still fun to look forward to every day. I've come to dig the ferret!"
17610,"Aardman does it again. Next to Pixar, Aardman proves again how to do animation properly. I had a great time watching the first episode of Creature Comforts."
17611,"Creature Comforts in America should have been released on a different network, or at least been given the chance to have its full run of episodes. Unfortunately, this was not the case."
17612,A social commentary that hasn't been seen on American TV since 'All in the Family' - and was blown away by a social commentary that hasn't been seen on American TV since 'All in the Family'

17616,"One of the best action films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long, long time!"
17617,Man's Castle is a wonderful example of a Pre-Code film. It involves realistic events with truly enjoyable and imperfect characters. Tracy is one of the great actors of the silver screen.
17618,"One of the best films of the Great Depression, and one of the best of the 20th century, and deserves to be more widely known. It's a real masterpiece of the period."
17619,"Loretta Young and Frank Borzage are the real heroes in this romantic drama.<n>It's an odd little movie, played mostly in a one-room shack in a Hooverville, unusually up-front about the Depression yet romantic"

17624,James Frain's best film yet...and it's not just for Frain fans...it's for non-Frain fans too.
17625,An insight into the world of loyalism in northern irish society. A very entertaining movie with stellar performances from a who's who in northern irish actors cast.
17626,"Excellent film from Thaddeus O'Sullivan featuring strong performances from a host of British and Irish actors. The film deals well with a thorny subject matter, and effectively captures the hopelessness and grim atmosphere of 1970s Belfast."
17627,Not as good as i thought it would be but not as bad as i thought it would be......
17628,"This movie shows how savage the troubles really are. People who do not want to be involved have no say in the way their lives are altered. This movie shows how the people of Northern Ireland, both Catholic and Protestant are held captive."
17629,"I liked Top Gun. It held my interest. Predictable plot, decent character development and story line. It is pretty similar to High Noon in that the town people appear weak and scared to stand up to a villain."
17630,"We all create our own reality, or do we? That is the core question behind this highly original and masterfully crafted examination of the illusionary nature of reality"
17631,A story within a story.............
17632,"Self referential to the point that you think it's going to fold in on itself like a black hole. The writer writes something and it happens, or something happens and he writes about it."
17633,This film made absolute sense to me. It was beautiful and that is all you need. Switch off the conscious control knob of the mind and job done.
17634,What is the price of the art for the sake of which it is acceptable to renounce one's own name and the day-to-day care for the young daughter?
17635,This movie is a journey through the mind of a screenwriter caught in his own paradoxical philosophy. He examines the ever illusive question of 'who am I' and 'what is I?'
17636,to communicate in film essential things of life - like what is life - does it have a meaning? - is sheer impossible. Few directors know how to communicate essential things.
17637,"I liked this movie very, very much. Not because of its plot, acting, jokes, no. I liked it, because its one of the worse movies ever created."
17638,If you like movies like Dude Wheres My Car and Dumb and Dumber this movie is for you. If your into movies like Citizen Kane and Casablanca id have to sugest you in a different angle. Yet i still love this movie and
17639,One of the funniest spoofs I've seen in a long time.........
17640,"One of the funniest, if not THE funniest, comedy movies I ever watched! (and I watched quite a lot!) It is about two garbagemen, who become ""Men in White"" and then stop an invasion from space."
17641,What is with all of the European (especially England) comments here? All i gotta say is that when i saw this movie for the first time when i was like 13 i thought it was great
17642,"One of the best 'National Lampoon's' films to date!! Men In White!!!! One of the best, most entertaining, funniest, best storyline, National Lampoon's film to date!!"
17643,HELLO! this film was made to be a random act of comedy and in no way involves a plot in any way shape or form. I would also like to remind these whiners that if you are going to flay the crap out
17644,"Gere's best performance in a long time, but the rest of the movie is OK too......"
17645,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time...and it's Richard Gere's first in a long, long time."
17646,"Not a great film but it's an interesting thriller.Richard Gere and Claire Danes bring competent performances.Now,let's go to the negative points.One element which really bothered me (there was a moment in which it irritated"
17647,Richard Gere is brilliant and Claire Danes is brilliant as well..........
17648,"Gere and Danes star as 2 workers for the department of public safety who keep track of released sex offenders. Gere, who plays Babbage, refers to them as his flock."
17649,"Not as good as Se7en, but still worth a look.........."
17650,"Well acted, suspenseful and very interesting movie. Richard Gere and Claire Daines are very good in it. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys serial killer and suspense type movies."
17651,It's a decent movie about a crazy guy who pushes the boundaries. Erroll did do a good job but at the sake of the safety of Allison. It has some good mystery to it too and just when I had it figured out
17652,"First movie this season that got my attention..I picked it because of the actors, Gere and Claire, and the story looked promising..I have just watched it and i can say - i'm overwhelmed."
17653,"It's like the X-Files without the X, in the way the story is crafted, the characters and the parallels drawn with the Chris Carter series. Richard Gere and Claire Danes pair up ala David Duchovny and Gillian"
17654,"Richard Gere is great in this film as the passionate agent/detective who bends the rules to get the job done. I think the story is great, and there's never a dull scene that slows the pace down."
17655,One of Richard Gere's best performances in a long time. But it's not quite as dark as he'd like it to be.
17656,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time -- and it's from the Weinstein Company.....
17657,"The best part of the film was the girl on the cross, she did the best job in the film.<n>She almost made S/M look like fun! She really was believable has the S/M model that gets"
17658,Richard Gere and Claire Danes' best work. Gere deserves an Oscar for his fine portrayal of a man being forced into early retirement as a sex offender registrar administrator. Claire Danes is riveting as the woman Gere handpicks to replace

17695,Indian Summer is a good film. It made me feel good and I thought the cast was exceptional. How about Sam Raimi playing the camp buffoon...

17697,I wish that I could be 10-14 again. When I watch it I wish that I could be 10-14 again. We all at times wish that we could relive our lives as children with the wisdom/knowledge of adults.
17698,"Not as good as I remembered and hoped for, but still well worth the $9.99 it cost me. After seeing the whole film for the first time I rate it as a 7/10, with potential to become an 8/10"
17699,A film that takes you back to a time when life was simpler and much more fun. It is a hidden gem that should be seen at least once a year just so you can sit back and laugh...and reminisce.
17700,"Not as good as The Big Chill, but it was pretty good for the first half hour. The movie turned out to be pretty good. Kevin Pollak was interesting as an old-style camp director, who admits that he has grown out"

17705,"""All Our Yesterdays"" is one of the best episodes of Star Trek's final season. (p.272) Spock's acting here was excellent as Freiberger candidly admitted to Shatner. (p.273)"
17706,Star Trek: The Next Generation--Time Travel--Time Travel--Time Travel--Time Travel--Time Travel--Time Travel--Time Travel--Time Travel--Time Travel--Time Travel-Time
17707,"One of the few times when Spock gets to show some ""emotion"" and Nimoy plays it to the hilt. Surprising to previous installment, Captain Kirk wasn't allowed to get the girl, another plus for this one."
17708,One of my all time fav episodes of Trek. This is certainly one of my all time fav episodes of Trek. There is just so much going on in this one film that its crazy cool.
17709,"One of the best episodes of the series, and one of the best of the third season overall. The intercutting between the two stories is superbly handled. A touching performance by Mariette Hartley as a woman exiled to the Ice Age."
17710,"'All Our Yesterdays' has its moments and overall a moody, compelling feel to it. The interaction between Spock and Zarabeth provides this episode's most memorable moments, though Kirk's adventure into the 'English' past is amusing"

17712,"""Hitler: The Rise of Evil"" was shrouded in controversy before it ever aired, and that controversy may obscure the accomplishment of the film. It is an important story that must be told"
17713,"Not as good as the previous 8 pages of comments about the historical inaccuracies. As long as people watching this understand that this is supposed to be entertainment 1st, history 2nd I don't think a lot of harm will be done."
17714,"An interesting movie reflecting Hitler's personality in a successful way. If you can stand directors that change history for cash, it is an interesting movie reflecting Hitler's personality in a successful way."
17715,"""Hitler, the rise of Evil"" is clearly produced by people emotionally unburdened by the horrors of World War 2. Which makes watching a refreshing experience."
17716,"Don't do this to history, and don't do it to the audience. It's a waste of time and money. It's a great movie."
17717,"Good, but not as good as Ian Kershaw's version of Hitler's life......."
17718,"This is a tepid docu-drama that covers no new ground, reworks all the cliches and is sloppy with facts. The movie also perpetuates the myth that the beer hall putsch was hatched at the Munich Hoffbrauhaus"
17719,"It's not 100% accurate. Of course it's not 100% accurate. It's difficult to make 100% accurate films nowadays when even the ""experts"" disagree with each other. Therefore I rather like to judge a movie by what it"

17743,This is a great movie that I don't think gets enough credit as Saturday Night Fever or in John Travolta's career. He plays a man who is in love with a girl but is too pig headed to admit his feelings to...
17744,"It's a modern love story... Texas style. There's gobs of cowboy hats, pickup trucks, neon beer signs, and references to big belt-buckles and rodeos"
17745,"One of John Travolta's best. He dances to disco, rock 'n' roll and country. He heads to Houston to find work and love. Gilley's is the hot spot, and it is the time of the mechanical"

17774,"The Running Man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even.brbrGladSchwarzenegger is on top form as Ben ""The Butcher of Bakersfield"" Richards, and the inclusion of Bond"
17775,"Another Excellent Arnold movie. This futuristic movie has great action in it, and is one of Arnie's best movies. I've always liked this movie and it has to be one of the greatest adventure movies of all time."
17776,"Imanol Uribe makes his best film since ""Das Contados"" (1994) with such a sober pulse, a beautiful photography, and a nice script"
17777,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, but it doesn't add much to what's already known about the Spanish Civil War."
17778,One of the best films of the 20th Century!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
17779,A very good Spanish movie but I am worried that many out there will feel lost because many around the world have no idea what the Spanish Civil War was all about or when it was fought.
17780,CAROL'S JOURNEY (EL VIAJE DE CAROL) is a beautifully crafted 2002 film from Spain based on the novel 'A boca de noche' by ngel Garca Roldn
17781,"I was deeply moved by this movie in many respects. First of all, I just want to say that Clara Lago was the most precious little thing!..."
17782,"CAROL'S JOURNEY is a pleasure to watch for so many reasons. The acting of Clara Lago is simply amazing for someone so young, and she is one of those special actors who can say much with facial expressions."
17783,"Clara Lago is wonderful as the title character of the film, essentially a film about a Spanish/American girl who moves to Spain with her mom at the time of the Spanish Civil War."
17784,"""Behind Bedroom Doors"" is a solid softcore flick with a solid story behind it.<n>""Behind Bedroom Doors"" had a great storyline, which enhanced the overall grade of the film."
17785,Behind Bedroom Doors is one of the few I've come across with those attributes. I like the girl next door scams on the neighbor's human nature and weaknesses where seduction and sex concerned.
17786,"The life of underground rock musicians is bitterly more intense than an ordinary one. The love between father and son, lovers, and friends is delicately and touchingly delivered through the fine performance."
17787,"One of the best movies I've ever seen, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time! I love Daniel Wu!"
17788,"it's a lovely movie,it deeply reflects the Chinese underground bands' current lives.<n>but one thing i am wondering is whether this movie has been..."

17791,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, even if it's not as good as I'd like it to be."
17792,just watched it on sky TV missed the first half an hour. i did wonder if it was a true story so watched it to the end. it did remind me of speed but at the end of the day i don't suppose it
17793,i thought it was pretty interesting my social studies/ arts teacher was the police chief guy that was holding the microphone on the water barrel part =D i was excited my teacher is in some commercials he was in a gas/coffee/phone/
17794,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, but it's not as good as I'd like it to be. I'd like it to be."
17795,The Devil Made Me Do It is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen! brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
17796,As a knowledgeable fan I recommend this film as faithful to the facts and well acted. I was surprised that this movie followed the facts very well with the exception of leaving out most of the sex and some of the drug use.
17797,"""Birth of the Beatles"", for being a US television movie, released in the fall of 1979 has actually been, so far the best movie which tells the tale of the the the four lads from Liverpool that revolutionized the music industry and the"
17798,"Birth of the Beatles is a good film, but not as accurate as some people might expect.<n>The Beatles-graduates should see that if the Beatles on the film only performed songs that they...."
17799,"The ""best"" version of this film was probably the earlier version I taped from 1981, which just so happened to include the ""Shake, Rattle & Roll"" scene that my 1998 version didn't"
17800,"Not as accurate as Best's version, but still a good film for a rock 'n' roll history buff....."
17801,One of the best dark noirs I've seen in a long time. I'm a fan of Gareth Maxwell Roberts and Lisa Ray's work.
17802,This movie really surprised me. I had my doubts about it at first but the movie got better and better for each minute. brbrIt is maybe not for the action seeking audience but for those that like an explicit portrait of

17804,"The first film to address the subject of rape and the emotional and mental effects that that crime has upon its victims. To my knowledge, this was the first film to address the subject of rape and the emotional and mental effects that that"
17805,"Outrage was a breakthrough, blazing a trail for later discourse on what the crime of rape really means to its victims. But Outrage was a..."
17806,Touchy topic of criminal rape never made it onto the U.S. screen before this little black-and-whiter. There were lots of these topics that Hollywood and the Production Code kept hidden until the 1960's.
17807,I think this one was a better film then that one. I think Leonard Maltin's review is right only to give it 2 and 1/2 stars.
17808,"Weird, weird, weird, weird, weird, weird, weird, weird, weird, weird, weird, weird, weird, weird, weird, weird"
17809,"the best high school movie i've seen in a long, long time. i've seen it many times, i've seen it many times, i've seen it many times, i've seen it many times."
17810,"A quiet, humble commentary on the pretentiousness of the art world. Waters clearly knows this subject well. Edward Furlong is fine as ""Pecker"" and Waters' non-histrionic style is at ease with the subject."
17811,"This is an Indie movie with an edge but not for everyone. It may seem boring or pretentious for some people but still I think it worth a watch only because it offers something ""different"" than Hollywood's typical standards."
17812,"One of John Waters' better films, if not his most accessible to date........"
17813,Another 10 out of 10! Another 10 out of 10! Another 10 out of 10! Pecker is another mainstream film by John Waters done on a smaller than Serial Mom. It doesn't matter if it's dirty or shocking when
17814,"The best thing about this movie is that it is fun. It is full of humorous characters and interesting situations, starting with the blithe, innocent Pecker (played appealingly by Edward Furlong) who likes to photograph almost everything he sees"
17815,"I m from Germany and I love the mvovies. I go 200 times a year. I saw ""Pecker"", it was a wonderful evening. Thank you, Mr. Waters"
17816,"""Pecker"" is a great comedy about the arrogance of the art scene, media hypes, middle-class sex angst and the strange ways of how to become a pop star without realizing it"
17817,"I'd love to see Jean Schertler(Memama) and Emmy Collins(Hippie in supermarket) cast as mother and son in a film, it would probably be the weirdest flicker ever made!"
17818,"This is John Waters best film to date. The characters are obvious and symbolic, just as in his other films. So there are no surprises or character changes. I enjoyed the film because of the wittiness and pace of the story."
17819,"One of the funniest films I've seen in a long, long time...and it's not just because it's a John Waters film!"
17820,"""Pecker"" is the best movie I've seen in a while. It is a celebration of life, liberty, and the right to bear arms...and everything else this country stands for."
17821,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.... and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
17822,One of the most interesting movies I've seen in a long time.........
17823,"One of the funniest films I've seen in a long time. A must see for anyone who loves John Waters, Christina Ricci, and John Waters."
17824,"""Pecker"" is a great film, perhaps one of John Waters' best. A wonderful cast, headed by strong performances by Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci"
17825,"John Waters's best work since ""Pink Flamingoes"", but it's tamer than his other cult films! A great comedy! A must-see for John Waters fans!"
17826,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time! I'll be recommending it to all my friends! I can't wait for it to be out on DVD!
17827,A twisted little ditty with plenty to look at and laugh at. It's like being turned loose in a museum of kitsch! I haven't laughed so much in a theater since Serial Mom.
17828,I thought this was an utterly charming film. The story seems to be a thinly veiled autobiography of John Waters: Pecker's greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places
17829,"""Pecker"" proves that Waters has no intention of changing his tacky ways in his old age. A lot of things have changed since Waters started making films in the 1960s, but 40 years later he is still doing what he wants to"
17830,"This is a very light headed comedy about a wonderful family that has a son called Pecker because he use to Peck at his Food. Pecker loves to take all kinds of pictures of the people in a small suburb of Baltimore, Md."
17831,"Not as bad as ""A Dirty Shame"", but it's a lot better than ""A Dirty Shame""<n>A lot better than ""A Dirty Shame"""

17839,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it many times, and I've seen it many times."
17840,"One of the most interesting road movies I've seen in a long time, but it's not for westerns. The movie isn't sophisticated but is charming in its own way, a kind of National Geographic with soul."
17841,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time...but I don't think I've ever seen it rated higher than 5 stars.
17842,"a fine road movie about a French family and a Muslim father and son, and their journey to Mecca in the Middle East to get to the holy city of Islam."
17843,An unusual film about a young French Muslim and his father's reaction to his decision to take him to the Hajj (pilgrimage) in Saudi Arabia.
17844,"A very thought-provoking, enjoyable and well-made film that I would recommend to anyone with brain and heart, for those who are not familiar with Islam"
17845,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
17846,"A gentle miracle of a film, a work made more profound because of its understated script by writer/director Ismal Ferroukhi who allows the natural scenery of this 'road trip' story to carry the emotional impact of the film"
17847,I've joined IMDb so people know what a great film this is! It's not often you come across a film that's moving and visually cinematic yet humble
17848,"A movie that portrays Moslems as PEOPLE, no stereotypes here. Finally, a movie that portrays Moslems as PEOPLE. This movie is driven by the story, by the acting and above all by its theme, that of cultural affirmation"
17849,I loved this movie when I was a kid. When I was growing up I saw this movie so many times that my dad had to buy another VHS copy because the old copy had worn out.
17850,A fun take on the Sword & Sorcery genre!brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
17851,Deodato brings us some mildly shocking moments and a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. Absolutely a classic in it's own particular kind of way
17852,"""The Barbarians"" really is a must-see Italian exploitation highlight. Eva La Rue never looked more beautiful as the witty savage girl Cara, Virginia Bryant is indeed bewitching like Richard Lynch states on several occasions and the lovely Sheeba"
17853,"The twins are very funny in their Conanesque roles. If you watch it while in a good mood and accept it as good, dumb fun you will have a good time."
17854,I love bad movies. Not only because they often are as entertaining as'really' 'good' 'good' films (like Pirates of the Caribbean series...

17862,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.........
17863,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more times than I've seen it. Tim Meadows has always struck me as being funny off of the Saturday Night Live show.

17867,This movie was so good. Leon Phelps is hilarious. I went out after and bought a case of Cognac!!!!! I went out after and bought a case of...
17868,A low-brow comedy that hits the funny bone with Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell at their best. Don't pop this one in expecting beautiful cinematography or Oscar-worthy performances. Walk into it expecting brilliant silliness with Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell
17869,Tim Meadows at his best. A big boost from Billy Dee Williams. He and a very funny John Witherspoon provide a solid foundation for Mr. Meadows' riffing
17870,I don't understand why people get so upset about this movie! I really don't understand how anyone couldn't laugh a lot during this hilarious film!
17871,"The funniest thing i've ever seen, but the vulgar language is the worst thing i've seen in a long time..."
17872,"""It's a lady! It's a lady! It's a lady! It's a lady! It's a lady!"""
17873,"If you're a ""Happy Gilmore"" type, you'll find this one hilarious. Tim Meadows has created a hilarious character, and Will Farrell continues to be hilarious in just about everything he does."

17880,I had no idea of the facts this film presents. As I remember this situation I accepted the information presented then in the media: a confused happening around a dubious personality: Mr. Chavez.
17881,An excellent documentary and a remarkable piece of work by a couple of novice filmmakers. The audience witness is just how the media manipulates the situation and in effect backs the overthrow of Chavez by events that transpire as the coup heightens.
17882,"A remarkable piece of documentary, giving a vivid depiction of a country deeply divided within itself (for further evidence, check out some of the comments on IMDb...!)."
17883,"""Being at the right place at the right time at the right place"" is true for this documentary. The story is nothing new for the people of the developing and/or poor countries. It sheds light on the manipulation of the people by"
17884,"One of the best documentaries released in recent years. Some points, but it's far too short. Makes a great companion piece to ""The Battle of Algiers""."

17899,"This is a great movie, it shows what our government will to to other countries if we don't like their government. This isn't as bad as what Reagan and Bush number one did to South America, but the US still has"

17907,"Barbara Stanwyck as a real tough cookie, a waitress to the working classes (and prostitute at the hands of her father) who escapes to New York City and uses her feminine wiles to get a filing job"
17908,This is a great film from 1933 which was produced by Darryl F. Zanuck and was locked up in a fault for many years and just recently is being shown on the silver screen.
17909,"One of the better of the ""forgotten"" films before the code. It was shown last night after the 1931 version of WATERLOO BRIDGE on the TURNER CLASSIC NETWORK, so I was able to watch the film as it is now"
17910,"""Baby Face"" is as contemporary in its morality as ""Wall Street."" Substitute Gordon Gecko for Nietszche, and Lily could have declared her guiding philosophy to be ""greed is good."""
17911,"""Baby Face"" with Barbara Stanwyck and Theresa Harris is a must-see for all lovers of sex, love, power, and sexy women!"
17912,"One of Barbara Stanwyck's best performances. She was one of only a handful of actors, then and now, who could say more with a single look than an entire page of dialogue."
17913,"Excellent, pre-code amoral tale with Barbara Stanwyck as the newly inspired (by writings of Nietzsche!) to drive out her sensitivities and exploit herself"
17914,"One of Stanwyck's best roles in a long, long time........"
17915,One of the last films to come out before the self inflicted Hollywood production code.Look for a cameo by a young John Wayne as one of Stanwyck's willing victims.

17922,One of the more risqué black and white films of this time in the early 1930's before the Hoyts Code was enforced. It's the story of a young beautiful woman moving to New York and making her way to the

17940,One of the best buddy films of all time and one of the best in the sci-fi/action/adventure genre of all time. George Lucas had to be a fan of this flick as so much of his Star Wars series seems to

17942,One of the great epics of the 20th century. A must-see for anyone who loves the story of the Gold Temple and the Thuggee huts.
17943,"Gunga Din is still a great film, entertaining and funny. It should be shown with A Passage to India and Gandhi and you can chart how the Indian independence movement evolved."
17944,"""You're a better man than I am Gunga Din"" ""You're a better man than I am Gunga Din"" ""You're a better man than I am Gunga Din"""
17945,"Not a moment of this movie is to be taken seriously. It's about Thugees, a sect in India, whence our English word ""thug."""
17946,"One of my all time favorites. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr...what a cast. Not to mention Sam Jaffe as Gunga Din."
17947,"Not as good as I thought it would be, but it's still a good movie......."
17948,Gunga Din is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time........
17949,One of the best British imperialist movies of all time. Get over it. I still get misty eyed and anyone who says they don't is a liar. The range of emotions within it is the mark of a great movie.
17950,One of the best films I have seen in a very long time.I think it is a very honest attempt to convey a belief in what is being attempted.It will make a man out of him.MaChesney says he could
17951,"My favorite ""Imperialism"" movie and one of the best action-adventure flicks of all time. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks dominate the screen with daring-do and wise cracks to please all but the most ""PC"" of film goers"
17952,"Gunga Din saves the day in this very funny buddy film. Grant, McLaglen, and Fairbanks do give very humorous and thrilling performances with Jaffe very well in the title role and Cianelli very sinister as Guru."
17953,Gunga Din is a must-see film for any fan of the British Army. Its about time it was released on DVD. The Sergeants Three are an unbeatable team.
17954,"The Greatest Epic to come out of Hollywood's greatest year, 1939.<n>Eduardo Ciannelli's performance as the Guru is an underrated element in the film."
17955,"""You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din""! One of Hollywood's classics and a perfect 10!!!! One of Hollywood's classics and a perfect 10!!!!"
17956,"Gunga Din (1939) is a marvelous adventure war comedy with plenty of thrilling moments.The three leading men are brilliant.Cary Grant is Sgt.Archibald Cutter, Victor McLaglen is Sgt.'Mac' MacChesney and"
17957,"""Gunga Din"" is one of the greatest adventure films of all time, with a wonderful musical score and some beautiful cinematic images. Sam Jaffe as Gunga Din, a simple, brave man with a big smile, powerful imagination and lofty"
17958,"""Now in India's sunny 'clime, where I use to spend my time as a soldier in the service of her Majesty the queen..."
17959,Gunga Din is the greatest movie of all time : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : :
17960,"This is a ripnorting, old-fashioned adventure yarn. I understand that by today's political standards, the treatment of the Indians was unacceptable. But this moving isn't..."
17961,One of the most entertaining movies of all time. Sam Jaffe is exceptional as the outcast water boy who is mistreated by all and still wants to be accepted as a soldier in the company.
17962,"Gunga Din is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.I have it in my collection. Excellent picture,i have it in my collection."
17963,"Gunga-Din's life, the life of a child, the life of a child, the life of a child, the life of a child, the life of a child, the life of a child, the life of"
17964,Early Hollywood at it's best!! A classic Kipling poem is transformed into an epic adventure featuring memorable performances by a stellar cast. I think the measure of a good film is how many times you can watch it and still genuinely enjoy it.
17965,"Cary Grant delivers more knock-about blows than he did in all of his movies put together. Set in faraway India, this six-fisted yarn dwells on the exploits of three rugged British sergeants and their native water bearer Gunga Din"
17966,"Gunga Din's secret is the division of labour in its writing team. The original story is by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, two of the most skilled and celebrated writers of Hollywood's golden age."
17967,Pokémon fans will love this movie. It introduces new legendary Pokémon (as each movie does) and adds depth to the relationships between its characters. I however do not expect those who are not Pokémon fans to enjoy it.
17968,This is a fun movie. My children sat quietly through the entire thing and loved every minute of it. I am glad that we got to enjoy this together.
17969,"""Pokemon is dead, blah, blah blah"" isn't really a comment on this movie, it's a comment on the fact that it's a Pokemon movie."
17970,I love this movie! Can't wait to own the USA version on dvd! Can't wait to own the USA version! I love this movie!
17971,"""Pokemon 4Ever"" is one of the best of the series so far, and more so than any other Pokemon film! :-) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)"
17972,"It's not the best, but it's still a good one. It's not the best Pokemon movie, but it's still a good one."
17973,The 4th Pokemon movie made me cry when Celebi died. Don't you dare say that Pokemon sucks! I don't like it when people say that....
17974,One Of The Best Pokemon Films Ever Made. Too Bad It's Too Bad It's Too Bad It's Too Bad It's Too Bad It's Too Bad It's Too Bad It's Too Bad It'
17975,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
17976,Ash and his friends take on Celebi a Misty to find all sorts of new things! Go join ash and Brock to find all sorts of new things!
17977,"One of Hideo Gosha's best films, and one of the best ""samurai/chambara"" films of all time -- if you're a Gosha fan!"
17978,"One of Gosha's best films, a must-see for Gosha fans and non-Gosha fans alike.<n>Gosha at his best in both Hitokiri and Goyokin"
17979,"A brilliant lesson on Japanese history set in at the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate shortly before the Shogunate lost a big battle against the loyalist, who wanted the emperor back on the throne to rule Japan."
17980,"""Tenchu"" (heavenly judgment) is the word that the loyalists to the emperor yell while assassinating enemies or ""traitors"" to the cause. Katsu plays up his character' simple minded allegiance to a manipulative politician all"
17981,This is one of the best of the genre. I saw it twice about 25yrs ago and have not had another opportunity to see it again since then. It rivals the Zatoichi series (also starring Katsu) in exciting swordplay
17982,"Tenchu aka. Hitokiri- directed by Hideo Gosha - starring Shintaro Katsu and Tetsuya NAkadei belongs (together with Goyokin, HAra Kiri & Rebellion) to the best chambara movies existing"
17983,"Simple, meaningful and delivers an emotional punch. I regularly trail through dull short films and it's always nice to come across something that has a simple and enlightened message."
17984,One of the best short films I've ever seen...........
17985,"I was absolutely mesmerised by this series from the moment Tom Long walked into shot - the whole 'bad boy' thing, it was just addictive.brbrThe story has you hooked, what will happen next - will Joey get the"
17986,One of the best Australian dramas I've ever seen! Tom Long steals the show! I can't wait to see Hugo Speers in it!
17987,"The Waiting Womans Ward of a large lying-in hospital, with all its joys and sorrows, is the place where LIFE BEGINS.brbr"
17988,"Life Begins - and ends - in a typical 1930's maternity / recovery ward, where we view 48 hours in the lives of several high risk pregnant women"
17989,Life Begins is a wonderful pre-code film starring some of the best of the era. Loretta Young is gorgeous here in her prime. Eric Linden comes out of nowhere and is sincere as can be.
17990,"Eric Linden, Loretta Young, Aline MacMahon, Glenda Farrell, Frank McHugh make this a good movie....."
17991,"I laughed, I cried! I thoroughly enjoyed it! I say, WATCH IT if you can, and don't listen to criticisms. As they say, I laughed, I cried!"
17992,"""Life Begins"": a look at the ""difficult cases"" ward of a maternity hospital. Loretta Young plays the lead. Glenda Farrell puts in an outstanding performance."
17993,"An interesting soap opera of women waiting to give birth in a psychiatric ward.<n>Glenda Farrell is an awful person, but she's pretty funny in most parts of the film."
17994,"Not as good as the 'Next Action Hero' show, but still fun to watch........"
17995,"Not bad for a made-for-TV movie, and Sean's character was very good in this one. I'm disappointed that he wasn't credited here on IMDb."
17996,"Corrine and Sean make a great team..it could be a sequel to bet your life-possibly called'making it big in the big apple',it could this time be about Carmen..Bet your life is EXCELLENT!"
17997,"Not a great movie, but a great showcase for two folks on their first time out of the gate. Not a great movie, but an entertaining one all the way and a great showcase for two folks on their first time out of the..."
17998,Sean and Corinne do a great job in this low budget action B-movie. I'll be looking forward to more of Sean and Corinne's involvement in the movie entertainment industry.
17999,"One of the fastest-paced and most action-packed of the German Edgar Wallace ""krimi"" series, a cross between the Dr. Mabuse films of yore and 60's pop thrillers like Batman and the Man from UNCLE"
18000,"What's not to like about a killer who sneaks around wearing a vivid red KKK looking outfit, complete with red gloves. I would describe it as a cross between the 60s Batman TV show and an Italian giallo."
18001,"Fun, cheesy fun, but it's not really stupid but it's cheesy fun. I saw many similarities between this and 'Creature with the Blue Hand' (AKA The Bloody Dead) and they do have the same director"
18002,"One of the best ""Krimi"" films I've seen in a long time, but I'm not sure if I'll watch it again!"
18003,"One of the best of the Krimi genre..if not the best..for it keeps you guessing, always one more ace up it's sleeve.."
18004,One of the best films I've seen about rape in the 80's.......
18005,"Farrah Fawcett and James Russo are outstanding in the lead roles. A real powerhouse. A real powerhouse. A.C. Redford's shivery, skin-crawling score greatly enhances the considerable claustrophobic tension."
18006,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Farrah Fawcett steals the show.......
18007,"Not as good as I'd like it to be, but still a good piece of film......."
18008,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time! I loved it! James Russo was so good I hated him he was the villain and played it wonderful. There aren't many movies that have riveted me as this one
18009,"This is not a movie that is supposed to entertain you.It asks a question is revenge justified.This is not a perfect movie, but I recommend it."
18010,"Farrah gets away from the ditsy roles that would forever stain her career. Kudos to director Robert M. Young, Fawcett really gets away from the ditsy roles that would forever stain her career."
18011,"I've never been a fan of Farrah Fawcett...Until now. She was truly amazing in this movie. I'm sure this makes a heck of a powerful piece of theatre, this movie for me, although it had merit, just"
18012,A must see for any movie fan. Farrah Fawcett gives the best performance by an actress on film in this gritty real life attempted rape thriller where she turns the tables & gives James Russo a taste of his own medicine.
18013,One of Farrah Fawcett's Best Performances as a Rape Victim.........
18014,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time. One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time. One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time."
18015,"""Le Locataire"" is one of Roman Polanski's best works. It is a psychological horror/suspense story about paranoia and obsession."
18016,"I'm not sure that it works, on the whole - the Polanski character's descent into paranoia and madness, which takes up the final half hour or so"
18017,"One of Polanski's best, and most chilling films yet. A must-see for anyone who loves horror movies. A must-have for any Polanski fan."
18018,"One of Polanski's best, but not among his most gripping works.<n>A rare chance to see Polanski in a major role, and his talent in front of the camera was as good as behind it."
18019,"One of Polanski's best, but it's not as good as you'd think......"
18020,One of Polanski's best performances as a diffident introvert in Paris........
18021,"It s one of the best horrormovies ever. It seems strange for me that some people call this movie a black comedy. On the one hand Trelkovski seems so nice and even cute in his shy behaviour, but on the"
18022,"I'm old enough to remember the taste of Oreos and Coke as they were 50-55 years ago, when every taste for a kid was fresh. I wish I have somehow set some aside then is some magical suspended locker, so that"
18023,"""Le Locataire"" is a disturbing and creepy tale of paranoia and delusion. The performances are awesome and Isabelle Adjani is extremely beautiful. My vote is eight"
18024,"Polanski is a genius of the first order and a credit to the human race. This film is the sum of many, many instances of great acting and great casting."
18025,Polanski makes us feel the inner torture of his characters.<n>Rosemary's Baby is a far greater achievement because sheer paranoia and plain rationality are in constant struggle.
18026,"One of Polanski's best, if not the best, films ever made........"
18027,"One of Polanski's best films, but it's not as good as ""Rosemary's Baby"" or ""Knife In The Water""!"
18028,"A good example of Polanski's ability to create suspense and portray madness in very convincing terms. And technically speaking, it's a marvel too. A slow pacing and sometimes uninteresting segments may make this movie difficult to enjoy, but it"
18029,SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER 
18030,Polanksi's obsessions show themselves in this film...but it comes off too much as a rehash of other Polanksi's better films
18031,One of Polanski's best films...and it's not just because he's the star...it's because he's the director!
18032,"A film that was not well received when it was made, but whose standing seems to be raising in time. 'The Tenant' is quite an interesting work by Polanski, one of the first of his European exile."
18033,The Tenant is one of Polanski's best.The Tenant is scary from time to time.It gives a lot of that psychological scare.This film is not the easiest one to understand or explain but that makes it all so fascinating.
18034,"The third film in Polanski's 'Unofficial Trilogy', and it's quite a creepy one, but it's not as bad as the other two."
18035,"This is my kind of film. I am fascinated by strange psychotic nightmares and this movie is just that. But it is also a dark comedy. While I see it mostly as a horror/thriller, there will be others who might see it"
18036,"One of Polanski's better films, but it's not quite as good as he'd like it to be - and it's not quite as good as he'd like it to be!"
18037,"One of Polanski's best, but it's not quite as good as he's made it out to be..."
18038,"""Le Locataire""(""The Tenant"")is without a doubt one of the most important horror movies ever made.Polanski stars as a Trelkovsky,a timid file clerk living in Paris,who answers an advertisement for an"
18039,"""The Tenant"" is Polanski's greatest film IMO. And I love ""Chinatown"", but this one is so much more original and unconventional and downright creepy. It's also a great black comedy."
18040,"Polanski returns to the themes of solitude and madness which he explored to such tremendous effect in Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby.<n>The Tenant is an enjoyable and intriguing experience, if a little too languorous for its own good"
18041,One of Hedy Lamarr's Best Performances... and one of the most erotic films of the 1930's.....
18042,"One of the most beautiful films I've ever seen; a must see for all lovers of early cinema, and love of the French language.."
18043,"One of the best films of the 1930's, if not the 20's. It's a masterpiece of cinematography and music, and also of editing, direction, writing, and acting."
18044,"Hedy Lamarr is a perfect choice for this 'Symphony of Love.' Hedy Lamarr, one of the great beauties of all time, was a perfect choice for this 'Symphony of Love.'"
18045,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, but it's not the best of today's films. I'm not saying it's better, but it's better than today's."
18046,"Hedy Lamarr gets her kit off, but it's not for the faint of heart. Hedy Lamarr gets her kit off. Hedy Lamarr gets her kit off. Hedy Lamarr gets her kit off."
18047,"One of my favorite films of the 1930's,but it was cut from the original version of it's release in the U.S. by the Hayes Office"
18048,"Hedy Lamarr's ""Extase"" is one of the most beautiful films of the 1930's.The film has a ""feel"" of a transition between silent and sound in its direction and concept."
18049,"""Extase"" (Brazil): ""xtase"" (Title (Brazil): ""xtase"" (""Ecstasy"")"
18050,"This was a very daring film for it's day. It could even be described as soft-core porn for the silent era. It was a talkie, but dialog was extremely limited, and in German. One did not need"
18051,"One of the most important films of the 1930's, and one of the best of the 20's, in my opinion......"
18052,Hedy had to change her name to avoid being associated with this movie. It was a huge scandal and I gather that the original release in the U.S. was so chopped up by censors that it was practically unintelligible
18053,"'Ekstase',a symphony (of sorts)to love. Worth a look if you have any interest in early European cinema,or Avant Garde/Experimental cinema"
18054,Hedy Lamarr and Eva Hermann are the stars of this classic film. Enjoy a great Classic film which was a Shocker Film in 1933. Enjoy.
18055,"One of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen in a movie...but it's slow-moving, obvious, static and had a negative ending."
18056,I was pleasantly surprised as Whipped is actually rather a good movie. I watched it with a group of friends and we laughed more than we had at many recent highly acclaimed Hollywood fluff comedies.
18057,"A hilarious and insightful perspective of the dating world is portrayed in this off beat comedy by first time writer/director Peter M. Cohen. See this movie, you'll laugh from start to finish"
18058,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time! I don't care if you're a man or a woman...it's funny!
18059,"""Whipped"" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. It's funny, it's funny, it's funny, it's funny, it's funny, it's funny"
18060,Not bad for a film that's so low-budget and so low-budget...and so low-budget...and so low-budget...and so low-budget...and so low-budget...and so low-budget...
18061,"Peter M. Cohen has a winner satire on the mating game, twisted around and turned inside out. The critical bashing of the movie in mainstream media publications as ""offensive"" and ""raunchy"" only serves to underscore its intensity as a"
18062,One of the best romantic comedies I've seen in a long time.........
18063,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. I laughed so hard I couldn't keep my eyes open. I laughed so hard I couldn't keep my eyes open.
18064,"""Whipped"" is one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time. The audience was laughing all the way through. I truly believe that it will be a big hit both domestically and over seas."
18065,"Sophmoric, but funny as all get out. Watch it with a small group or party of mixed gender and 97.3% of the room will laugh for 2 hours straight. And the other 2.7%...can you ever really please them?"
18066,Cheech & Chong's Next Movie is funny but not as good as the first one. Tommy Chong takes over the directing reigns for the sequel..
18067,"A typical Cheech and Chong romp through Cheech and Chong's reality which includes drugs, singing, more drugs, cars and driving, even more drugs, Pee Wee, aliens, gasoline, laundry, stand up comedy, surprisingly more"
18068,"I'll tell you why: this movie was very ill-advised. EVERYTHING CONCERNING DRUGS IS CUT OUT AND COVERED UP!!! Well, they don't do it very well, that's for sure. Anyway"
18069,"This movie is fun to watch, doesnt have much of a plot (well, there isn't a plot), but there are good jokes and situations that you will laugh at"
18070,"One of the worst C&C movies I've ever seen, and one of the worst TV versions I've ever seen. I'm not sure who created it, but it was horrible."
18071,"The best Cheech & Chong movie so far!! I think I've seen them all about twelve times at least, and I love them all. But this is most definitely the best. Compared with the others this one covers a lot of"
18072,"One of the funniest films I've seen in a long, long time, and one of the funniest I've seen in a long, long time."
18073,This is the best Cheech & Chong movie I've seen in a long time. I'm sure you'll laugh at it. I'm sure you'll laugh.
18074,"What Monty Python's Holy Grail is to geeks and nerds, so is this movie to potheads. I first saw this film 10 years ago or so, and I still crack up every time I watch it."
18075,"The best Cheech & Chong movie I've ever seen, but it's not the best movie I've ever seen. It's the best movie I've ever seen."
18076,This was stupid funny movie.. Cheech and Chong are the dopiest wasted guys ever... i rate this film a 7.. but if you like this one then go see Jay and Silentbob!
18077,"Tom & Jerry's ""Mammy Two Shoes"" vs. Jerry's ""Mammy"" vs. Jerry's ""Mammy Two Shoes"""
18078,"""A Mouse in the House"" is a very classic cartoon by Tom & Jerry, faithful to their tradition but with jokes of its own. It is hysterical, hilarious, very entertaining and quite amusing."
18079,"Tom and Butch Cat fight over the capture of Jerry Mouse because the one who doesn't catch Jerry gets kicked out. Confused, Tom and Butch whack their master's rear and all three of them get kicked out."
18080,"Action & Adventure.Billie Clark is twenty years old, very pretty, and without a care in the world,until a brutal street gang violates her life, and she turns into an ALLEY CAT bent on revenge!"
18081,"One of Karin Mani's best roles, but it's not her best work........."
18082,A slow but beautifully-mounted story of the American revolution. Griffith's story-telling seems a lot less heavy-handed than in his earlier historical epics and his tableaux work is fully integrated into the action.
18083,D.W. Griffith's first big hit since ORPHANS OF THE STORM (1921) and it's not just for the 4th of July!
18084,"I really wanted to like this film and I don't think I was terribly disappointed. Being an American History teacher, I felt an obligation, almost, to see this film and as far as the history went, it wasn't bad"
18085,"The Pride of the Clan - Pickford, Tourneur, Moore, and Joy are highlights of this feature 1917. Not a great Picford film, but still worth seeing. Not a great Pickford film, but still worth seeing."
18086,A very nice film of the silent genre with lots of action! A very nice film of the silent genre with lots of action! A very nice film of the silent genre with lots of action!
18087,"Pickford and Tourneur bring great beauty and intelligence to this story of poor, isolated Scottish Islanders -- the same territory that Michael Powell would stake twenty years later for his first great success"
18088,"Strangler of the Swamp is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long, long time....."
18089,An amazing piece of film making that is probably unique in film history. Its a good little film that I some how wish was slightly less poverty stricken. Its definitely worth a look if you can come across it.
18090,One of the best B/W horror films I've ever seen.........
18091,One of the best low-budget films of the 80's..and it's not about the story..it's about the setting.
18092,Very well done and spooky horror movie from poverty-row film company PRC who usually put out really cheesy films like DEVIL BAT or THE FLYING SERPENT
18093,The Best Picture Producers Releasing Corp Ever Made. Probably. Probably. Probably. Probably. Probably. Probably. Probably. Probably. Probably. The Best Picture Producers Releasing Corp ever made. Probably. Probably. Probably. Probably. Probably.
18094,"Great use of props, sets and effects (fog, lighting, focus) to create an eerie and moody texture. The story is farfetched, the acting is merely functional, but it shows how imaginative effects can develop an entire visual narrative."
18095,One million times superior to any of Fellini's cinematic sh#@t! Definitely not for the pretentious.I personally think this film is one million times superior to any of Fellini's cinematic sh#@t!
18096,"Caged Terror is one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time! I've watched it more than once from beginning to end! If I could find this on DVD and replace my old tape copy, I'd"
18097,"One of the most underrated horror films I've ever seen. It's not the greatest, but it's certainly a lot of fun. It's possible to find it in a lot of stores if you look hard enough."
18098,The second episode was so memorable I still remember it today. I became a fan of Dick Francis. I would recommend it if you are interested in horse racing and mysteries.
18099,I actually quite enjoyed this show. Even as a youngster I was interested in all sports and that included horse racing. It was always going to be difficult to make a series based on racing corruption and at the same time get permission from the race
18100,"One of the most beautiful movies I've seen in a long time, and I've seen it with my two young daughters as well. I recommend it to adults as well."
18101,"The Fox and the Child is a great film, but it's not a child's film. It's not really a film I would pay hard earned green to go see and I'm racking my brains to try and recommend"
18102,"Not quite as good as March of the Penguins, but it's still worth a watch......."
18103,Great for kids who aren't used to watching fox stories. Still worth it if they can sit still. Still worth it if they can watch it.
18104,"""The Fox and the Child"" is an act of love intended for any innocent heart. Dare I say it is an act of love intended for any innocent heart. It reaches to the heart of the viewer--and reveals the world through"
18105,"stunning and breathtaking,leaves you in ore. seen it twice once in a cinema and now on DVD but on the big screen this was something else."
18106,"Beautiful, but not as good as I thought it would be. It has very limited distribution in the U.S., but it's still beautiful."
18107,"This is a very beautiful and almost meditative film-there is hardly any dialogue in it, apart from the narration; and the scenery and music compliment each other perfectly"
18108,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time...and I'm not just saying that because I'm a nature lover...I love it!
18109,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time, and it's not just because I've seen it. It's because I've seen it."
18110,"This is a true story, not a movie that glorifies Che or anyone else. It's a very good movie, not a bad one."
18111,One of the best films I've seen in a long time.........
18112,The most talked-about American film in the 2008 New York Film Festival is 98% in Spanish. Ironically the most talked-about American film in the 2008 New York Film Festival is 98% in Spanish.
18113,"One of Soderbergh's best, if not the best, films of the year. 8.5/10. The second part is sadder, but in some ways better than the first."
18114,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best of Soderbergh's films to date."
18115,It's the dark turn of Che's life that is the real reason why most people prefer Part One to Part Two. I posit that it's the dark turn of Che's life that is
18116,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, but it's not quite as good as I'd like it to be."
18117,Soderbergh's second film on the life of Che Guevara is an excellent follow-up to last year's Oscar-winning The Informant
18118,"Che: Part Two is the best of Soderbergh's ""biopic"" experiments, and it's the best of the first one too."
18119,"Soderbergh's ""Che: Part 1"" and ""Che: Part 2"" don't do justice to Che's life, but what do you expect from Soderbergh's ""Che: Part 2"""
18120,"Che Guevera was a hero for the people, not for the powerful elite. That's why I give this film a 7 out of 10 for it."
18121,"I felt consumed by the inevitability of Che's death; for me, it clouded the entire movie. I suppose that is exactly what Soderbergh wanted us to feel"
18122,Soderbergh continues his fact based telling of Che's life. Part 1 told a story of a revolution moving from unpromising beginnings to an ultimately successful conclusion. Part 2 tells a story of a revolution that moves from unpromising beginnings
18123,"One of Soderbergh's best films, but it's not as good as the first one, but it's still very good."
18124,"A great achievement, but not quite as entertaining as Part I.<n>It's clear now that Che is not as charismatic as Fidel.."
18125,"Che as a whole or in parts is a commercially balls movie, one where its director begins by understanding the limits in cinematic biography and working progressively within those means"
18126,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best films I've seen in a long time."
18127,"'Che: Part 2' is better than 'Che: Part 1',but not as good as 'Che: Part 1',but still better!"
18128,"Soderbergh doesn't look down on these people, but it's also clear he's not going to plea their case to 'yanquis' far removed from the recent past"
18129,One of the best documentaries I've seen in a long time - if not in the history of the film industry! I'd give it 5 stars if I could!
18130,"It's a coup d'etat, it's a documentary, it's a coup d'etat, it's a coup d'etat, it's a coup d'etat, it'"
18131,A remarkable account of a country struggling to attain democracy... a charismatic leader (Chavez) who actually cares for his people... a story about power and greed as a coalition of corporate/military/media interests combine to lead a coup of a
18132,Not bad for a low budget zombie film. It's still fun and entertaining. It's coming out on DVD. It's better than I thought it was.
18133,One of the best action movies of the 1970s. It not only features a great cast but is also loaded with wild shootouts and explosions that are still impressive today.

18139,This movie was very good because it remember when I was young when I maked snow castle. It was so fun. This movie is interessant.
18140,"A great movie for all ages, but it is directed more for children. I love the childlike humor and appreciate it. If you have not seen it, you should try to rent a copy, you will not be disappointed!"
18141,"Tom Hulce, Ray Liotta, and Jamie Lee Curtis make this a tear jerker..a.m.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a."
18142,This movie bears a resemblance to my life that is so striking that it is truly scary. The rest of you will never know how accurately that movie depicts how persons who have been in situations like that...
18143,One of the best films I've seen in a long time - and it's not just because it's Tom Hulce and Ray Liotta!
18144,"It's a tough movie to watch, at least in the second half of it. I think this might be Hulce's best role ever. He's looked after a med student, ""Eugene,"" played by Ray Liotta"
18145,"One of the best films I've ever seen, and one of the best movies I've ever seen in my entire life, and one of the best I've ever seen."
18146,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, but it could have been better."

18148,"I loved this movie! It was all I could do not to break down into tears while watching it, but it is really very uplifting. I was struck by the performance of Ray Liotta and Tom Hulce portraying Ray's twin brother"
18149,TOM HULCE'S BEST PERFORMANCE IN A LONG TIME! TOM HULCE! TOM HULCE! TOM HULCE! TOM HULCE! TOM HULCE! TOM HUL
18150,"One of my favorite movies I saw at preview in Seattle. Tom Hulce was amazing, with out words could convey his feelings/thoughts. It is good. System says I need more lines but do not want to give away plot stuff"
18151,One of the Best Movies of the 90's! SPOILER ALERT!                 
18152,"Ray Liotta and Tom Hulce shine in this sterling example of brotherly love and commitment. Hulce plays Dominick, (Nicky) a mildly mentally handicapped young man who is putting his 12 minutes younger, twin brother, Liotta,"
18153,One of the best little films I've ever seen. Tom Hulce's performance is wonderful. I recommend it to those who love the movie.
18154,"I'm gonna tip the scales here a bit and say I enjoyed this. However, the cartoon is really only going to appeal to those who have very absurdist tendencies."
18155,"One of David Lynch's best, if not his worst.. but still fun to watch........"
18156,"Don't look to this series if you want an artistic masterpiece- this is anything but. As Lynch says, ""If this is funny, it is only funny because we see the absurdity of it all."""
18157,"This is not a movie to enjoy, though you'll sometimes laugh out of a strange, perverted sense of humor. This is an animated reflection of all things we rather reject to observe, with its simplicity, morbidity and absurdity."
18158,"I'm gonna tip the scales here a bit and say I enjoyed this. However, the cartoon is really only going to appeal to those who have very absurdist tendencies."
18159,Dumbland is worth half an hour of your time...........
18160,"Dumbland is a mark of 'I get it' or 'what the hell'. It's also very, very, very stupid. But in this stupidity can be a sort of ironic intelligence to it"
18161,"Dumbland is not for all. In fact Dumbland maybe in for nobody except Lynch and that's what make it funny and a collective cartoon. The more Lynch episode of all, music, surrealism and a very sweet revenge..."
18162,"A bit of a puzzle for a lot of the artsy Lynch crowd. They tend to try to write this off as some kind of meaningless, crude, side project of Lynch's."
18163,This is a horror film at it's core. It's not dull like other horror films where a haunted house just has ghosts and gore. This film doesn't even show you the majority of the deaths it shows...
18164,"A Slower-paced, Surrealism-Based Horror Film, But Still A Good One.<n>The Grudge is a Good Remake of a Japanese Film Series."

18170,One of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time.........
18171,"I was really scared, a good thing. I love horror-movies, and I really liked this one. There were so many'surprise'-scenes (what's the English word?) that made you jump in your seat. Though"
18172,"The Grudge is a very scary film, in both it's well executed 'jump' scenes, and it's creepy imagery. I've been a horror film fan for many years, and I'm talking about the masters"
18173,"It's not a bad movie either. Just a rather well made horror movie. It does not rely heavily on special effects, but on camera angles, acting, music. In my opinion, Sarah did a very good job, quite convincing"
18174,This is the scariest movie i have ever seen. I can't believe i haven't slept with the light on. I can't sleep with the light on.
18175,"This is a film you will enjoy watching, or hate. It's as simple as that. It's a film you will enjoy watching, or hate. It's as simple as that."
18176,This is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen! I love it! I recommend this to horror fans! 10/10 and 5 stars! I did not see the Japanese version!

18185,"A cute little film about a missing winning lottery ticket and a long list of people trying to get it. And, during the search there are lots of jaunty little songs that you can't help but like."
18186,"A wonderful early musical film from Rene Clair, as fun and witty as his silent ""The Italian Straw Hat"". Should (but won't be seen by all cinephiles) be seen by all cinephiles"
18187,One of the best car chases I've seen in a long time. I'm glad to own it on DVD. It's one of the best films I've seen in a long time.
18188,I'm a fan of Crash and Blade Runner and this movie explores some of those highway death and 80s film noir themes that I like to see...
18189,"If you're a Val Kilmer fan, you'll like this movie. If you're a John Holmes fan, you'll like this movie."
18190,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.........
18191,A decent murder mystery thriller from an eccentric cast of often drugged out potential killers/suspects. Please read the plot synopsis for the exact details of the movie's plot. I wish to contribute more to a review than a synopsis.
18192,"One of the most disturbing and tragic periods in American history began. The members of the Summer of Love culture, at the end of the seventies and onset of the 80's, were eventually tool old for love beads and all night parties and evolved"

18197,"Val Kilmer and Dylan McDermott are terrific. I have seen Kilmer on The Doors, however his interpretation of John Holmes is superb. Wonderland is a movie which is able to show you a horrible crime story from the perspective of a guy who is just"

18200,"One of the best movies I've seen in the last few years, even if it's just for a few minutes....."
18201,"Very good acting, but over all story left a lot to be desired. This movie has the same texture and look of Panic in Needle Park or Drugstore Cowboy. Hard to believe that human beings can live this type of lifestyle..."

18206,"Grittiness, lack of glamor and desperation drew me into the film and kept me there. I was truly impressed by how dates and information were relayed within the film..."
18207,"Not a romanticized portrayal of the porn industry in the vein of Boogie Nights and that is not the case here.In fact,except for a few references made by newscasters that John Holmes is a porn star and a brief montage"
18208,"A ""Rashamon"" of the sleazy Hollywood set, the film splitters the July 1981 Wonderland murders through a variety of angles, but mostly through the filter of John Holmes' coked out weasel brain"
18209,"This is not an Alice fairy tale. No, this is not a Holmes movie. No, this is not an Alice fairy tale. No, this is not an Alice fairy tale. No, this is not an Alice fairy tale."
18210,"A pretty good film, but the crime scene video disturbed me. I wonder if Lion's Gate REALLY thought that the general viewing audience would want to see people that were brutally beaten to death and blood all over the place. Sorry Lion'"

18213,We could use Black Adder even today. Imagine Rowan Atkinson resuming the role of assistant to the prime minister played by the wonderful Hugh Laurie. Hugh is sensational as the dimwit Prince George and Edmund as his brilliant assistant.
18214,The 3rd and in my view the best of the Blackadder series.brbrThe only downside is that there is no Lord Percy who was the funniest character from the previous series but Hugh Laurie's Prince Regent is suitably mad
18215,"""If you want something done properly, kill Baldrick before you start""<n>""If you want something done properly, kill Baldrick before you start"""
18216,"The best of the Blackadder series - and Hugh Laurie is at his best in this series. Very good! 8/10. 9/10. Rowan Atkinson's role as a butler to a stupid prince is a funny and effectively done one, and Hugh"

18224,American Gothic is one of the best shows I've seen in a long time! I've seen it more than once and it's still the best!
18225,I finally got my hands on the complete set of American Gothic on DVD! I loved this show when it aired on television and was crushed when I found out that someone somewhere decided that it wasn't worthy of being continued!
18226,They had me from the first show. A sleepy little Mayberry-like place with one slight difference. The sheriff is really Satan. There's the spoiler. Not like you wouldn't figure it out in 10 minutes anyway. Not
18227,"I really like this show. I can readily see how it achieved cult status. It's original, and thought provoking. For some reason though, I have never felt the kind of resonance from it that I could have."
18228,This is the best show ever made and it is still is the best show ever made. The writing was 1st class and the production second to none. This show would never be made today and that this is a shame.
18229,I remember this show and how obsessed I was watching it every week (in my town)..brbrI started looking for this series..
18230,"Great show on DVD, but not the ""extras"" that were added to the box set. (A director commentary from Shaun Cassidy on the Pilot episode) and the episodes are shown in the same order they were put out on TV."
18231,One of the best TV shows I've ever seen...........
18232,Bring on the DVD box set!! This show is quality viewing for a discerning market hungry for quality viewing. A public that is tiring of over-saturation of mind-numbing reality fare will welcome this gem of real storytelling.

18238,This was an absolutely spellbinding series and was sorry that I was only able to catch a few shows way back when it aired late night in the UK. The style of it was so different and the whole thing had an unnerving air of stylish dread

18253,I really enjoyed this movie. Britney is an excellent role model for teens and should be more appreciated. This movie is about following your dreams and never giving up no matter what people might do or say to discourage and criticize you.
18254,This is one of the best films i've seen in a long time! I've seen it twice and i love it! I'd just like to say that i've seen this film twice now and i love it!

18261,Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper still can turn the world on with their smiles. The combined talent of these two wonderful stars make this combination reunion/newstart movie work
18262,Mary & Rhoda is very funny and well written. They didn't spend too much time rehashing the past so they weren't relying on the success of the old TV show to carry the movie.

18267,Paresh Rawal does a great job in this movie.... and John Abraham does equally well...
18268,"One of the more sensible comedies to hit the Hindi film screens. A remake of Priyadarshans 80s Malayalam hit Boeing Boeing, which in turn was a remake of the 60s Hollywoon hit of the same name, Garam"
18269,Garam Masala is one of the funniest films I've seen in ages. Akshay Kumar is excellent as the womaniser who has affairs with 3 girls and engaged at the same time. John Abraham is Amusing at times and this is one of
18270,Okay this movie fine like I said but you surely need to watch it as its worth a watch.<n>It's about two boys Mac and Sam who are great friends and work as fashion photographers and the laughing time starts when Mac (

18275,"Who votes in these ratings? ""Jacknife"" is a beautifully acted, brilliantly observed piece of work, with actors on top of their game, especially Ed Harris and the peerless Robert DeNiro"
18276,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time - and it's not just because it's a romantic comedy. It's because it's so touching.

18280,Jacknife is a masterpiece of the 80's. It's a movie that breaths through amazing acting and a very interesting directing touch. In Jacknife both lovers of European and American cinema can find things to relate on.
18281,"One of the best war movies I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it's a war movie. It's because it's about life."
18282,One of the best films I've seen in a long time. Still find it a great Vietnam movie. Not sure why its not higher rated. As a vet (not from Vietnam) I can relate to the situations brought by both Harris
18283,"DeNiro and Harris are great, but the script is too loose compared to the Deer Hunter. The Vietnam flashbacks are not as gripping or involved as the ones in the Deerhunter. This is why I can only give this movie 7 out"
18284,"One of the few that try to deal with the second sad side of the war: The time after. Different from movies like ""Taxi driver"" or ""Rambo"" which use to present their main characters as broken heroes in a bad after"
18285,A quiet film about the bonds of friendship and shared experience. It's a quiet film about the bonds of friendship and shared experience. We even get romance (not gratuitous -- just another very real piece of this story)
18286,"I agree wholly with Ebert's review. In a sense, I feel that I should not even be commenting since it is so much a vet's movie and I am not a vet (I was a resister)"
18287,"An enjoyable game, which offers fun and easy game play and fair replay ability. Staying true to the comic and providing a low learning curve gives this game something not seen in most action cartridges today."
18288,"A great tribute to the Marvel comic books, but short and short. Better luck in ""Spiderman 2,"" better in ""Spiderman,"" better in ""Spiderman"""
18289,"Spider-Man is the best superhero ever, and this game is the best superhero game ever! I gave it an 8 out of 10 for the game!"
18290,"The best Spider-Man to hit the market!You fight old foes such as Scorpion,Rhino,Venom,Doctor Octopus,Carnage,...And exclusive to the game...Monster-Ock!"
18291,The original spiderman game for the PC for a couple of years now.I still have not beaten it because on Windows XP there is a glitch on one level which I cant beat because of it.So be warned if you have XP
18292,If you're a fan of 'ol Web Head then you owe it yourself to pick this up for your gaming library. Swinging around the city as Spidey has never looked this good and dead-on in a video game.
18293,"Fun, but not as good as some of the other Spider-man video games. But still a fun ride. The plot is interesting and the fighting is fun."
18294,"This could have been one of the best Summerslam's ever if the WWF didn't have Lex Luger in the main event against Yokozuna, now for it's time it was ok to have a huge fat man vs"
18295,"This was the first PPV in a new era for the WWE as Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior, Ric Flair and Sherri Martel had all left. A new crop of talent needed to be pushed."
18296,"One of the best pay-per-view's I've ever seen, but it's not for the faint of heart....."
18297,"It's been 16 years since it's original run, I would have hoped by now some ""marketing wizard"" would have promoted a live actor version of this classic by now, or at least sought to re-release the original 65"
18298,One of the best cartoons I've ever seen..and still continues to outshine today's cartoons..I can't wait to track down some of the DVD's to share with my little guy and see the same sparkle
18299,I gave it a high 7.....I gave it a high 7.....I gave it a high 7.....I do hope for more DVDs or even a set of all the episodes in proper order
18300,One of the best cartoons I have ever seen. Please put it out on DVD. Please. Please. Please. Please. Put it out on DVD. Please. Please. Please. Put it out on DVD. Please. Please. Please
18301,"It's really boring in the DVD format. The shows are all basically identical. When viewing non-sequential episodes on a DVD, you're stoned by disk #3. By today's standards, the animation is spotty"
18302,"One of the funniest films I've seen in a long time, if not for the fact that I've seen it on a full-size screen."
18303,"My all-time favorite movie. Betty Grable's costumes were so ravishing that I wanted to grow up to be her and dress like that. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. was irresistible as the dashing Hungarian officer."
18304,A very strange mix of musical (a remembrance of The Merry Widow?)and classic Lubitsch touch sentimentalism (an impossible love-story like Cluny Brown)yet a very clever and intelligent one yet not to be understood as some nostalgia
18305,"""That Lady in Ermine"" is a fairy tale, and it's a good one. But it's not ""Down to Earth"" or ""Down to Earth"" or ""Down to Earth"" or ""Down to Earth"""
18306,"Not as good as Shane's earlier films, but still a good one. Granger's good in the role of the shunned ex-gunfighter."
18307,"Not as good as the other Laurel and Hardy films, but still a good one........"
18308,"A good summary of what the boys brought to the screen. Richard Cramer (uncredited) appeared in other L&H flicks, and he is delightfully threatening here as the convict Nick Granger."
18309,"SAPS AT SEA is a toss-off little film. It's just that it is a toss-off little film, without the crazy destructive crescendo of BLOCK-HEADS or the astounding sight of Stan's ""real"" personality"
18310,"One of Laurel and Hardy's best, but not as good as they were back in the day......"
18311,It's not vintage L&H but it's far from being their worst work as at 20th Century Stupid...I mean Fox. This film certainly has all of the basic ingredients for things to go wrong for the boys. But
18312,"One of Laurel & Hardy's best short films, but it's short on the big boys......."
18313,"It's the last time Stan and Ollie worked at the Lot of Fun. Besides being the last time they worked at the Lot of Fun, it's also the final time they would appear with such familiar supporting players like Charlie Hall and"
18314,I can't believe people are looking for a plot in this film. I can't believe people are looking for a plot in this film. This is Laural and Hardy. Lighten up already.
18315,"One of the best L & H films ever made, and one of the best of the latter days. I'd say all in all one of my favorite L & H comedies. Charlie Hall and even Ben Turpin show up!"
18316,"Laurel and Hardy at their best in this little-seen film. A pity that many of their films are now generally unavailable to the public. Even in a minor entry like SAPS AT SEA, one can see that Laurel and Hardy were great"
18317,"A pretty good episode. I enjoyed it but wouldn't rate it as anything special. In all, a pretty good episode. I enjoyed it but wouldn't rate it as anything special."
18318,Christine McIntyre's best performance with the Stooges. She is absolutely brilliant. Her singing is not funny at all. Her plot is constructed in such a way that the singing enhances the humor rather than detracting from it.
18319,"Micro-phonies is a classic Stooge short. The guys are inept repairmen working at a radio station, and Curly's perfect mimic of a recording of ""Voices of Spring"" is mistaken for the real thing."
18320,"What a great stooge flick, this should not be missed!brbr""Disorder in the Court"" is at a tie with my other favorite flick ""Disorder in the Court"""
18321,This is one of the funniest films I have seen in a long time! brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
18322,One of the best Stooges short films ever made..and it's funny..and it's funny..and it's funny...and it's funny..and it's funny..and it'
18323,"This is the funniest of the Curly stooges shorts. I've seen it dozens of times and it always makes me laugh. A perfect example of ""musical comedy"""
18324,The stooges are at it best. In Micro Phonies the stooges are at there best. In this short the trio are handymen working in a recording studio. They end up getting a look at Alice Van Doren singing the

18326,"I was surprised to read some of the comments on this work, honestly. Some people were looking for a plot??? OK, when this video came out over a decade ago, I watched it for what it was: a collection of music videos"
18327,"I'm a huge Michael Jackson fan, I grew up with his music, Thriller was actually the first music video I ever saw apparently. But Moonwalker was what started to be a tribute to all of Michael's success of the time"
18328,"I've loved this movie ever since it first came out. I was about nine years old, and now I'm 27. I would love to show my son this movie. He likes Michael Jackson as well and I know he will"
18329,"It's not bad, but it's not Michael Jackson's best work, and it's not even good enough for me to give it a 7 out of 10"
18330,"If you want to remember MJ, this is a good place to start. This movie features sweet tunes, MJ as robot, and a crazy, messed-up plot. I recall, many a night, passing out to this fine feature film"
18331,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once.
18332,"I was a kid.. crazy about Michael Jackson. His music, his dancing.. he was and is the greatest of all times. Few days ago a friend gave me a present.."

18334,"It's a great movie, but it's not as good as you'd expect. It's not as good as you'd want it to be."
18335,If you're a big fan of Michael Jackson this is a must. If you're not a fan/don't like Michael Jackson steer well clear.
18336,A great tribute to the King of Pop and his work for the benefit of Africa........
18337,Michael Jackson is the King of Music Videos. He will always be the King of Pop. He will always be the King of Pop. He will always be the King of Music Videos.
18338,This is a very neat film. I think that it is a very neat film with great song play and good imagination. Not to mention the film center piece Smooth Criminal which has some of the best dancing you will every see.
18339,Michael is a genius and always will be!!! Moonwalker is one of the best movies I have ever seen..and i love the mini movie too!
18340,"A very good film, especially for Michael Jackson lovers. It contains a message on drugs, stunning special effects, and an awesome music video.brbrThe main film is centered around the song and music video 'Smooth Criminal.'"
18341,"Great music, great FX, great time to enjoy with your kids. If you compare this movie, you have to remember is a pop extravaganza. Clips of ""Man In The Mirror"", ""Leave Me Alone"", ""Smooth Criminal"""

18343,"A must for Jackson fans, a must for music fans, a must for dance act fans, a must for Michael Jackson haters out there: DON'T watch this movie, you'd only make your hate increase..."
18344,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time! I've seen it a few times, but never liked it as much as this one!"
18345,What else can I say!?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
18346,"I have Bad.I have Bad.It is excellent(*****).The movie begins with Michael Jackson performing ""Man In The Mirror""on stage.then,it shows a history of Michael,from his early days in the Jackson 5 right"
18347,MOONWALKER IS A MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
18348,One of Michael Jackson's most well known and beloved films comes to DVD! A NOTE TO PEOPLE IN THE USA LOOKING FOR THIS FILM ON DVD: Make sure when buying this film on DVD you buy Warners Product #WK008
18349,Michael Jackson as an actor was good and so were the other cast members. There were a disturbing scenes like the little girl Katie getting slapped by the gangster Frankie Lideo who was played by Joe Pesci.
18350,"My childhood memories of this movie are those of a child from 20 years ago. For that little kid who watched it in 20 years ago though, this is definitely worthy of a 10."
18351,Moonwalker is a Fantasy Music Film staring Michael Jackson with different segments. I will rate each segment individually. My Overall rating for this Movie is 8/10brbr
18352,"This is my all time favorite!!! You really have to see Michael Jackson in this wonderful film!! I'm always over the moon, watching it!! This is a film, that you really have to see, cause this film writes, like"
18353,"Michael Is King. This film contains some of the best stuff Mike has ever done. Smooth Criminal is pure genius. The cameos are wonderful, but as always, the main event is MJ himself. He is the best, hands down"
18354,Moonwalker by Michael Jackson is a real adventure film for the whole family!brbrI recommend this for every family who wants to spend a nice night together with candy and popcorn in front of the TV
18355,THIS MOVIE ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
18356,One of my all-time favorite Twilight Zone episodes - and it's not just because it's about two lonely souls in a post-apocalyptic world.
18357,"Wow! If Elizabeth Montgomery is the enemy (she speaks Russian), then I'm surrendering right now. In her short skirt, high-top boots, and pronounced bust line, she's a real babe"
18358,"An important take on the long Cold War that the U.S. was then embroiled in. The beaten-down city-scene, the near-starving characters' sparse dialog, their threadbare uniforms, and the minimal action ""say"
18359,"It's a quiet, slow moving, chess battle as they attempt to achieve trust. They come to truces but distrust takes over and they start again."
18360,"""Two"" is a great example of how the Twilight Zone, in just over 20 minutes, could pack more emotion and drama than most two hours movies today"
18361,Simple story... why say more? It nails it's premise. World War 3 kills all or most of the human race and we're viewing 2 of the survivors.
18362,"If you're a kid, you'll like this show. If you're a kid, you'll hate it. But if you're a kid, you'll like it."
18363,It's one of the best British kids' shows there is. It's a shame it's ending because it's very funny (if a bit cheesy sometimes) and has great characters.
18364,"I actually like Kerching. I actually like Kerching. It's about a teenage boy named Taj Lewis, in order to make £1,000,000 for his mother, he sets up a website called rudeboy."
18365,"This was the best show to appear on ""Oddities"", hands down. It's ""Donnie Darko"" before there was ever such a thing."
18366,"""The Maxx"" is a fascinating world where the fantasy and the reality are combined.<n>""The Maxx"" is very faithful to the material in what it was inspired,not only in the story but also in the graphic style "
18367,"The Maxx is not to be missed for the artwork, the story itself, or the excellent voice work - particularly the late Barry Stigler's deliciously urbane, drippingly evil voicing of the main villain, Mr. Gone"
18368,One of the best animated shows I've seen in a long time.........
18369,"A great film, despite its budget limitations. Despite its budget limitations, this is a great film, proof that effort and imagination can overcome lack of cash."
18370,One of the most entertaining monster-on-the-loose films of all time........
18371,One of my all-time favorite so-laughably-lousy-that-it's-totally-lovable el cheapo and stinko nickel'n'dime independent horror creature features
18372,"C'mon people, look at the title! LOL! I remember seeing this movie on Saturday Late Night Creature Features years ago. It's a great, cheesy monster flick with hilariously bad acting and two wonderfully moronic hillbillies that"
18373,Crater Lake Monster is a real drive-in monster movie..........
18374,Good B movie fun for all ages. I didn't scare me but I was 8 and anything B felt more like an A. Years later I seen it on DVD and bought it immediately so I can give it a 9

18376,One of those movies that makes you want to watch it over and over again........
18377,the best bonnie and clyde movie i have seen. it has more accurate accounts of what happened and while it doesnt glorify their crimes it casts the pair in a normal light.
18378,"The Best Zombie Movie I've Seen in a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long,"
18379,A total blast to watch from start to finish                    
18380,One of the best B-Horrors I've ever seen..........
18381,"A fun little film that is VERY rough around the edges, but still had me laughing and enjoying the ride! Overall, this is a solid, if flawed, release with plenty of extras and TONS of gore and splatter!"
18382,Zombie Bloodbath is the best zombie movie I have ever seen. It is a party movie to enjoy with friends. It is fast paced and energetic and really funny. It is a party movie to enjoy with friends who like loads of splatter and
18383,"It's still a turkey, but it's grown on me over the years as a sort of camp classic. That said, this has really grown on me over the years as a sort of camp classic."
18384,"One of the best ""party tapes"" I have ever had the pleasure of watching. And you could tell it was done on no money, with a bunch of crazy people."
18385,"One of the best ""party tapes"" I have ever had the pleasure of watching. And you could tell it was done on no money, with a bunch of crazy people."
18386,"I swear, that zombie was killed like twice, and kept coming back. I gave this movie an 8. Let's face it folks, this is exactly what the other reviewers are saying, i.e., a ""handy"
18387,"This is one of the best zombie movies I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it's so gross! It's because it's fun!"
18388,One of the best films I've ever seen about radicalism in the 60's and 70's. I've seen it many times since.
18389,Don't waste your time and money on ZP. It's a great movie. It's a great movie. It's a great movie. You can't get anything out of it in a straight frame of mind
18390,"This is one of Antonioni's most beautiful films and he got the very best out of the man made and natural landscapes. Oh, and I haven't even mentioned the highly explosive ending."
18391,"It s a very interesting film tho, very beautifully shot with some brilliant and Antonionian scenes in between, like the love-making in the desert, the stillness of the desert mansion and the explosive ending..."
18392,"one of the best films of the 60's and 70's, but the middle of the film is a bit too long, the love scene is a bit too long, but the whole time you can imagine this desert feeling."
18393,"""We know it all, we'll change everything for the better""<n>A powerful, frightening film that applies to anyone, any time, any place"
18394,"One of Frechette's best films, and one of the best of the early 70s counterculture.<n>The best thing about this movie was the slow-motion scenes of debris floating in the air after an explosion."
18395,"""Zabriski Point"" has to be evaluated for what it was when it was released. It was a great film if you were to see it on a wide Panavision screen as opposed to the dwarfed TV screens."
18396,"Disney's ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" is not the only educational film from Walt Disney Pictures, but it does show ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" elements like the turning of the page and the use of animation to tell the story"
18397,"It is a pleasant film that simply gives the facts of menstruation in a reassuring, ""matter-of-fact"" way. I hope to show it to my daughter"
18398,"Great educational film, but Disney should've used Minnie Mouse instead of this one. I think this would've been a great film, but Disney missed a real opportunity."
18399,"This is one of those ""keepers"" that will become increasingly hard to find as older short subject features fade into obscurity. This is one of those ""keepers"" that will become increasingly hard to find as older short subject features fade into obscurity."
18400,"Heart pounding erotic drama are the words that come to mind when I think of ""Secret Games"". It becomes more erotic as the film goes along and at one point blew me away!"
18401,"One of the best escort films I've seen in a very long time. I've seen it more than once, and I've seen it more than once."
18402,"Not a masterpiece, but still a good introduction to some of Flynn's best work.....or should I say ""old fashioned love stories""..."
18403,A tragic and bleak tale of love with an unexpected plot point in the very end in less than eight minutes. The soundtrack is beautiful but the volume is a little loud and associated to the fact that English is not my native language.
18404,"An odd film for me, but a good one for Ryan Jafri's first feature film, THE CURE. Good idea, but too easy to foresee."
18405,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time! I've seen it a few times, and it's just so real!"
18406,A very good short film with a very good story and a very good twist ending. It is worth the watch if you are a fan of Indies and/or short films.
18407,"An avant-garde film, but let's be honest; it's not a great one......."
18408,"Not sure if it was right or wrong, but I read thru the other comments before watching the short.I have to say I disagree with most of the negative comments or problems people have had with it."
18409,"Ryan Jafri's ""The Cure"" is a great short film, with a great camera work and music, but a bit too much v/o (narration)"
18410,The Cure uses voice over to create an intense mood. Although the VO accounts for all of the film's lines it amazingly does not take away from the visual story.
18411,A nice little neo noir story that I felt was not a waist of a few minutes of my time. I was given a lot of information in a short period of time but through great editing and voice-over work it didn't feel
18412,"Ann Sheridan is the one true shining light of this movie. To paraphrase a cliché, she could read from a phone book for two hours and I would buy the DVD!"
18413,"One of the best films of it's time, and one of the best actors of it's time, and one of the best actors of it's time."
18414,"It's a pretty good film, but it's not a great film. In fact, this isn't a great film, it's sure a lot of fun to watch, so I will give it a 7!"
18415,The Dead End kids have larger parts as the plot concentrates on them rather than in the older folks. The only interesting thing is how tamed these kids were in comparison with what's going on with the youth in America's inner cities today
18416,A preview of what many of the boys would become in The Bowery Boys series. This is a preview of what many of the boys would become in The Bowery Boys series. We even get a few garbled words from Leo Gorcey.

18418,"If you grew up in the 80's and love Heavy Metal, this is the Movie for you. They really don't get much better than this."
18419,A great movie if viewed in the proper context - It was meant to be a parody of teen-horror-devil-worship movies (and the '80s saw plenty of them)
18420,One of the best horror movies of all time. One of the best movies of all time. One of the best movies of all time. One of the best movies of all time.

18422,TRICK OR TREAT is a movie that will bring a smile to the face of any 1980s metaller and has a kick-ass soundtrack courtesy of the cult band Fastway
18423,This is my favorite film of all time..and it's not just because it's cheesy..it's because it's awesome..and it's awesome..and it's awesome..and
18424,"Best heavy metal horror item made in the manically headbangin' 80's.<n>Marc Price gives a surprisingly strong and winning performance as Eddie ""Ragman"" Weinbauer"
18425,"This is a true ""80's movie"": Back then they made maybe 100 times more movies than nowadays, and that makes many of them quite interesting..."
18426,"One of the best 80's horror films ever made. Well worth watching. Sammi himself is an original horror movie villain, plays on the 'evils of rock music' obsessions of the 80's."
18427,"Trick or Treat, Quickie Review, Trick or Treat, Trick or Treat, Trick or Treat, Trick or Treat, Trick or Treat, Trick or Treat, Trick or Treat, Trick or Treat, Trick or Treat, Trick or Treat,"
18428,One of the best 80's movies I've seen in a long time.........
18429,Not as bad as people make it out to be...........
18430,"This is a great, ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of the mid to late 80s' obsession with how evil metal music supposedly was. And you gotta love a scene where a guitar shoots lazers and vaporizes headbangers in"
18431,"A cool story for all those kids who remember the PMRC and albums before there were warning stickers, it's a cool story for all those kids who were part of the mid to late 80's headbanger crowd"
18432,Skippy from Family Ties goes from clean-cut to metal kid in this fairly cheesy movie. The film seems like it was made in response to all those upset parents who claimed metal music was turning their kids evil or making them kill themselves...
18433,I love this movie and never get tired of watching. The music in it is great. Any true hard rock fan should see this movie and buy the soundtrack.
18434,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.........
18435,"""Trick or Treat"" is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen."

18441,"""Trick or Treat"" is the best 80s rocker horror film I've ever seen. I've seen it more times than I care to remember."
18442,The Hungry Bachelor's Club is a great film! Jorja Fox is a stellar actress in her own right! I couldn't have done better myself!
18443,"Jorja Fox's best role yet, but it's a little short on some parts of the movie. I'd give it 5 stars if I could."
18444,A fun way to spend an hour and a half with the family. The film is finally being released in video where it should have debuted in the first place.
18445,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time!"

18449,"One of the best indy films I've seen in a long time, and it's set in Pensacola, Florida. That's a bold move in the film world today."
18450,"This is Crosby at the top of his game. I like the Road pictures, but Bing was a comic talent onto himself and this film better demonstrates than any other."
18451,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time..........
18452,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.........
18453,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time!! I love this movie!! I've seen it over and over and over again!!
18454,"Great Music, Great Movie, Great Story, Great Music, Great Movie, Great Music, Great Movie, Great Movie, Great Movie, Great Movie, Great Movie, Great Movie, Great Movie, Great Movie, Great Movie, Great Movie,"
18455,"Don't be fooled - it's not a Rodgers and Hart movie, it's a Burke and Van Heusen one. It's a good one."
18456,"Still great fun, even if it looks like it's 50 years old........"
18457,"""World's Finest"" is a trailer for a Superman/Batman crossover movie that doesn't exist and will also never exist, at least not in this form, with these characters, actors and plot line anyway."
18458,"One of the worst examples of Hollywood's lack of respect for comic book characters..well, at least until you look at it from a studio executive's point of view."
18459,"One of the best short films I've ever seen, and one of the best movies I've ever seen...and one of the best movies I've ever seen!"
18460,this is the best batman/superman film i've seen in a long time. i've seen it a few times and i still love it.
18461,"Not as good as I thought it would be, but I'd pay to see it, if ever made. I'd probably pay to see a film, if ever made, and would be sure to catch it on television."
18462,One of the best fan-made films I've seen in a long time--and it's a preview for a new Batman/Superman movie!
18463,"World's finest is a 7/10,but i didn't think it was as good as the other two films.i liked this one the least."
18464,"It looks good, but it doesn't quite match the energy of Grayson's work..<n>It doesn't quite match the talent of Fiorella, either.."
18465,"One of the best ""superhero"" movies I've seen in a long time! A real ""superhero"" movie that makes you feel like you're there!"
18466,This needs to be made into a full-length movie...........
18467,"I've just seen it....for those who don't know what it is, I suggest to download the entire feature and enjoy viewing it...it's kinda amateur made trailer featuring the same producer of the famous short Batman Dead End"
18468,"Not as bad as BATMAN: DEAD END, but not as good as BATMAN: DEAD END, and not as good as BATMAN: WORLD'S FINEST"
18469,Don't waste your time and money on this one. It's not going to be a great movie. It's not going to happen for now.
18470,"Mdchen Amick, Alice Krige, Glenn Shadix, Ron Perlman, Clive Barker, Tobe Hooper, &amp; Stephen King!"
18471,"Fun, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-"
18472,"Not as good as Sleepwalkers, but it's still a good movie, even if it's not as good as King's.."
18473,"Not as bad as it could be, but not as bad as you'd think........"
18474,"Stephen King was raised on flicks like this. -Flicks NOT films. -Stop trashing what has already deemed itself as trash. -Good, fun, trash!"
18475,"This is not a good movie but I still like it. I think there is more to this movie than people realize, basically it is very harsh, but this brusqueness can sometimes be good."
18476,"Sleepwalkers is a good adaptation of Stephen King's story, but the acting isn't as good as I'd like it to be."
18477,One of the worst horror films I've seen in a long time...and I've seen it more than once...and I've seen it more than once.
18478,"Not as bad as I thought it would be, but not as good as I thought it would be......"
18479,"Woah! I'm one of those people who loves cats so that would have been a big down side to the movie, but I loved it how cats from every were got their revenge at the end."
18480,"It's not bad, it's not bad, it's not bad, it's good. It's fun. It's fun. It's fun. It's fun. It's fun."
18481,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
18482,"Fun, but not as good as the TV show it's based on, but still a fun movie......"
18483,"""The Great Smokey Roadblock"" is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time...and it's not just because it stars Henry Fonda."
18484,"Street Fight is a brilliant piece of brutal satire. This is not a movie you just watch for fun. It is not a comfortable experience, although it does have some laugh-out-loud moments."
18485,"One of the most interesting movies to be classified as ""blaxploitation,"" Bakshi's ""Coonskin"" is a rich text full of wonderful insight"
18486,"One of Bakshi's best, but it's not quite as good as he's made it out to be...."
18487,"It's a satire of the old Uncle Remus stories that the Black American culture, created right down to the main characters and the blatant nod to ""The Tar Baby"" and ""The Briar Patch"""
18488,"Bakshi's ""Coonskin-on Afro Video"" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time! I loved it!"
18489,Coonskin is an entertaining animated film that's worth checking out.Worth watching for Bashki or Blaxploitation film fans.The film mixes live action and animation sort of like the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit.I would have
18490,"One of Ralph Bakshi's best, but it's not just in-your-face and not ashamed of it for a second. It's in-your-face and not ashamed of it for a second."
18491,"Bakshi's ""Coonskin"" is one of the best films I've seen in a long, long time....."
18492,"Racist, but good. And it's actually pretty good. The movie takes place in Harlem Nights (No, duh, it was a working title.) but with a twist that becomes a lampoon of a Disney movie, Song"
18493,"""Bustin' Out"" is a better title than ""Blacksploitation"" or ""Racism"" or ""Blacksploitation"" or ""Blacksploitation"" or ""Blacksploitation"" or ""Blacks"
18494,One of the best cartoons I've ever seen..and I've seen it many times..and I've seen it many times..and I've seen it many times..and I've seen it
18495,One of the most brilliant movies I have seen in recent times. Goes way above even any international movie of any repute. Sonali Kulkarni winning the National Award is perhaps the only consoling fact. Renuka Daftardar simply
18496,One of the best movies I have ever seen. I just wonder how can movies like Lagaan and Paheli can go for Oscar and not Doghi.
18497,"Doghi is a wonderful movie and Renuka Daftardar is excellent. So is Uttara Baokar who is usually excellent in most of her roles. Along with Kairee, its an example of Marathi cinema at its best."
18498,Sumitra Bhave's 'Doghi' is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time            
18499,"A good drama cum romance, a true combination of what Bollywood can offer a clean entertainer. To summarize I would say it is a good drama cum romance, a true combination of what Bollywood can offer a clean entertainer."
18500,I liked this movie sort of reminded me of my marriage. Very clean you can see it with family. Very nicely done. Songs are OK too. I think the writer director is great.
18501,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
18502,"It's a rehash of many recent films only this one has fewer stars, lesser complications and a more fuzzy feel to it. Abhay and Ritika (played by Fardeen Khan & Esha Deol respectively) meet at a friend"
18503,"It's a fine, fine night, it's a fine, fine night, it's a fine, fine night, it's a fine, fine night, it's a fine, fine night, it's"
18504,"Yolande Donlan as ""the new princess"" of Lampidorra, the 49th state of the U.S.<n>The only big name here is Dirk Bogarde as Tony Craig, cheese vendor."
18505,A delightful blend of British farce and romantic comedy. Yolande Donlon once again plays a role that Marilyn Monroe would have been cast in if the film had been made this side of the pond.
18506,This movie needs to be put on DVD. It was so funny and I loved it. The only thing I did not like about it was the girl relying on the guy too much. It represents the time period way of thinking though.
18507,Dan Jansen the Greatest skater ever. A touching and beautiful movie the whole family can enjoy. The story of Jane Jansens battle with cancer and Dan Jansen love for his sister.
18508,The spirit of Dan and his family is what matters here.brbrIts a worthwhile movie of a story that should be told. I felt empathy for the characters and cheered at the end.
18509,A Brother's Promise is a wonderful family film. The faith of the family is shown in basic terms and is obviously a major part of their lives. This is a powerful family film which can be meaningful for a person of any age.
18510,"Beautiful Story of Dan Jansen, and his real life, struggle to win the 1994 Olympic Gold Medal in Speed Skating, despite his overwhelming emotional loss with the death of his much loved Best Friend and Family Member; his Sister, Jane!"
18511,"Thomas Ince's ""The Italian"" Brings Homespun Homespun Stories to Life with fullness and flair. ""The Italian"" is such a film. Solid acting, particularly by George Beban, and wonderful sets convey a realistic feeling"
18512,"Stunningly shot, with lighting effects that are truly sublime. This is an early gem that clearly reveals REGINALD BARKER to be a pioneer director of equal standing to D.W. GRIFFITH and MAURICE TOURNEUR"
18513,'The Italian' is among the great or near-great films of 1915 that are available today. The most overriding artistic achievement of 'The Italian' is its stunning and often innovative cinematography.
18514,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time...even if I've never seen ""Rhoda"" or ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"""
18515,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time - and I've seen it more than once! I've seen it more than once!
18516,Eglantine Price is an outstanding actress and a great story. Great family entertainment and we need more films like this today. Never viewed this 1971 film and was greatly entertained by this great production created by the Walt Disney Studios and great animation creations
18517,Delightful Disney film with Angela Lansbury in fine form as a middle age spinster whose interest turns to witchcraft in World War 11 England.brbrLansbury was about age 51 at the time of the film and she is just ideal
18518,"Fun, frolic, adventure, something for everyone. This is a musical the tunes are every bit as catchy to sing later as any of the other Disney films. Add this to your Family Video Library. You will not be disappointed."
18519,The march of the suits of armor is a great sequence in this movie. (For the time.)brbrThe plot is very original and entertaining. The animated sequence is also very well done with the live actors. (For
18520,"A great movie. Lansbury and Tomlinson are perfect, the songs are wonderful, the dances, with a particular mention for the ""Portobello Ballet"""
18521,"A magical tale of hocus pocus that is cute, light hearted, & charming. Angela Lansbury is of course marvelously endearing as the eccentric witch in training, Miss Price."
18522,"What a great gem this is. It's an unusual story that is fun to watch. Yes, it has singing, but it is very nicely crafted into the story and is very melodic to hear."
18523,i love bed knobs and broomsticks so much that it makes me cry a thousand tears of joy every time i have the magnificent pleasure of seeing it. i would also like to reiterate the simple fact that i love it so much.too much
18524,Bedknobs & Broomsticks is another one of Disney's masterpieces. It was filmed with sequences of animation and the actors and actresses interacting with the animations. (A similar concept was used in Mary Poppins when the children and Mary disappeared
18525,"I loved it as a child and still love it today. It's still fun to see it on DVD, but it's not as good as it used to be."
18526,"The greatest low budget horror film of all time. I love this movie for what it is, a comedy, and until the movie industry wises up, I will forever hold this great piece of indie horror close to my heart."
18527,I'm glad that users (as of this date) who liked this movie are now coming forward. I don't understand the people who didn't like this movie...
18528,This is one of the funniest movies that I have seen this year. The people that made it must be so incredibly whacked and twisted. It is a beautiful thing. There were a lot of quality one-liners.
18529,"Surprisingly good. The acting was fun, the screenplay was fun, the music was cheesie fun, the plot was stupendously fun. This was a fun movie to watch and to give your brain some rest."
18530,"Not as good as Troma, but it's still fun to watch.                "
18531,This is not a kid's movie and should not be confused with Disney movie of the same title. If you do not let your children watch pg-13 movies alone than parents should not let their kids watch this movie.
18532,"Jack Frost is a good movie, but don't take it too seriously. Just put your brain on hold and have fun with it. Just put your brain on hold and have fun with it."
18533,A B-Movie Comedy Horror that's full of puns and a killer snowman brbr br br br br br br br br br
18534,JACK FROST...I give it 9 STARS...I give JACK FROST...I give JACK FROST...I give JACK FROST...I give JACK FROST...I give JACK FROST...I give
18535,"This movie is goofy as hell! I think it was written as a serious film, but then when it came time to film, Michael Cooney said ""Hey, let's throw in some humor and spice it up!"""
18536,One of the best B-movie's I've seen in a long time.......
18537,"one of the funniest films i've seen in a long, long time........"
18538,"How can someone NOT like this movie??? This movie is so good, that the first week I saw it on the shelf at the video store it was stolen.... BEST Horror Movie Ever!!!....I mean he took the Carrot and he...well"
18539,One of the best horror/comedy movies I've seen in a long time...and it's not just because it's a horror flick.
18540,"okay, but just plain dumb. Not bad for a horror/comedy film. I was reading how people switched it with the Michael version and that is a good trick in my opinion because..."
18541,"Jack Frost is One of The Best Films of the Late-Nineties. I Think this Movie was Actually one of The Best Films of the Late-Nineties. That is, Be Original and Give the Viewer What they Do not Expect."
18542,"The best, most extreme piece of art come from way underground. If you don't stick to the same old formula that people are used to seeing, then they reject it."
18543,"This film is like marmite. You either love it or you hate it. If you go into this film expecting a proper film with decent production values, a good plot and great characters you'll probably hate it."
18544,One of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen. Schizophreniac is one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen. Schizophreniac is one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen. Schizophreniac is one of the
18545,"A really sweet movie that has some similarities to the 2001-hit ""My Sassy Girl"" but is able to enchant most of the time. Ha-Neul Kim is both sweet and quirky, Sang-woo Kwon is both attractive and rebellious"
18546,One of the best romantic comedies I've seen in a long time.........
18547,"It's a chick flick, it's a romantic comedy, and it's pretty cute too. I'd watch it again...with a girl."
18548,My Tutor Friend is one of the best Korean films I've seen in a long time! brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
18549,"Like ""My Sassy Girl"", it's a romantic comedy, but it's not quite as good as ""My Sassy Girl""<n>It's cute, but it's not quite as good as ""My Sassy Girl"""
18550,My Tutor Friend is a well scripted romance comedy movie that has something similar to My Sassy Girl.. there's no kissing/sex scenes. Hollywood should learn more from Korean productions.
18551,"Very funny and well-done. Kim Ha Neul plays a cute tomboy very well. Kwon Sang Woo also plays his role very believable. What I like the most about this film is, the emotion of the characters are not too exaggerated."
18552,"I liked the fighting scenes, the acting wasn't that good and the characters weren't very interesting. For a Korean movie... I liked the fighting scenes."
18553,"Kira Reed and Doug Jeffery are the stars of this erotic thriller. Julie Davis' direction is a great gift to erotica, and Kira's acting is superb."
18554,"All Kira Reed fans MUST see this film. This is easily the best of these soft-core Playboys films I've seen. Check this out, and marvel at the greatness of Kira Reed."
18555,"""Losing Control"" is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I wish I had come up with the idea first!!brbr10/10"
18556,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
18557,One of the best films I've seen in a long time!brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
18558,I'll be brief. There's some great acting and funny lines from the attractive cast. A young graduate of Harvard Med School (Brian White) finds out he doesn't know as much as he thinks about people.
18559,This is a really funny (and sexy) movie - that is not just silly but has great acting. It's the kind of movie where the characters are so entertaining that you feel like you are connected to everyone in the theater.
18560,"I still have grainy, late night, no-cable, cheap VHS dubs of this show from waaaaaa back when, late-night-commercials and all, when I would stay up to whatever weird hour they would slap this show"
18561,This is one horror movie based TV show that gets it right. Friday the 13th the series had no connection to the movies. Poltergeist the legacy: I'm not so sure. It feels like they just throw a famous title
18562,"Freddy's Nightmares is one of the best TV series ever made. It's a rip-off of Freddy's Nightmares, but it's brilliant."
18563,"i love this show so much.it scared the hell out of me when it first aired in 1988.of course it would i was 5 years old.but i recently purchased the DVD of the first 3 episodes,which unfortunately i hear is now"
18564,"One of the funniest things to come out of the 80s ever. Watch it. If you're looking for something that'll scare you stay away. If you're looking, on the other hand, for one of the funniest"
18565,Robocop & Freddy vs. ANOES: The Series & Robocop: The Series & Freddy vs. ANOES: The Series & Freddy vs. ANOES: The Series

18567,"One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long, long time........"
18568,One of the best comedies I've seen in a long time -- and I'm not just saying that because I'm a fan of Ben Stiller.
18569,"not as funny as i thought it would be, but still a great movie for both ben stiller and jack black fans ive laughed my ass off a few times"
18570,"Not as good as what I expected, but still a fun ride. Not as good as WHAT ABOUT BOB, or DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS but what is? It is still worth going out of your way a little"
18571,"One of the best comedies I've seen in a long, long time, but it's not the best movie I've seen in a long, long time!"
18572,"I thought it was alright, for a Ben Stiller movie. This movie isn't for a person without a good sense of humor. Or like I said you have a good sense of humor."
18573,"One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long, long time........"
18574,The critics are dumb. This movie is funny and smart. I loved this movie a lot. Why does everyone hate this movie so much. I wish people would love this movie more than they don't.
18575,One of the best action movies I've seen in a long time.........
18576,"A great cast, a great film, a great cast, a great cast, a great film, a great cast, a great film, a great cast, a great film, a great cast, a great cast, a great film."
18577,Laurence Fishburne's Othello is the real deal!brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
18578,"Great performances, too short plot, too many lines cut out, too many characters, too many characters, too many scenes, too little time together, too short."
18579,"Othello, the classic Shakespearen story of love, betrayal, lies, and tragedy........"
18580,"Iago's character was so evil and despicable, the character was played so well by the Kenneth fellow! even thoough Iago is really evil and despicable, the character was played so well that it does what shakespeare intended for"
18581,Othello is dark-skinned and Desdemona doesn't have fair hair like almost always. I was especially delighted that in this movie Othello himself was dark-skinned and Desdemona didn't have fair hair like almost always.
18582,"I've never seen a performance of Othello with more humanity and authenticity. Fishburne's Othello is so powerful in this beautifully edited film. (Even Shakesspeare, after all, can be improved upon, now and"
18583,"Honest Iago, Honest Iago, Honest Iago, Honest Iago, Honest Iago, Honest Iago, Honest Iago, Honest Iago, Honest Iago, Honest Iago, Honest Iago, Honest Iago,"
18584,Fishburne's Othello is a strong figure familiar to taking action. Iago's temptation to actively deal with what is presented to Othello as his wife's unfaithfulness is a perversion of the general's positive quality to
18585,"Kenneth Branagh steals the show, but Laurence Fishburne is a fine actor. Nice to see the views of Venice, too. Nice to see the views of..."
18586,Iago and Desdemona are the best pair of actors I've seen in a long time. I love Kenneth BRanagh as Iago and Lawrence Fishburne as Desdemona.
18587,"Excellent performance by Branagh and Fishburne, but lack of Desdemona's depth hurts the integrity of the film.<n>The story, cut or not, is still incredibly enthralling"
18588,"Laurence Fishburne's ""Othello"" is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.<n>Irne Jacob and Kenneth Branagh are outstanding as Desdemona and Iago"
18589,Shakespeare would have been proud. Kenneth Brannagh on the other hand was brilliant. His scheming was wonderful as was his toying with the audience. Very nice work.
18590,He was a riot. He was a riot. I can remember seeing him on TV at the end of his run when he was winding up the series in 1971 or so.
18591,Red Skelton was still another major star who made the transition from movies to television with ease.brbrHis shows certainly brought a laughter to the American households of years back.
18592,I'm ashamed to say i rather like it. Not often can such a huge pile of 80s pap be found outside of a Wham! video
18593,"""KOR the conquerer"" is a great movie, and the music is great too. I like Bo Svenson, and the boy, who played Simon in the movie. Manfred Kraatz, Germany, 26.10.2004."
18594,"Not as good as the first one, but still worth it for Gulfax's appearance!               "
18595,One of the best movies I've ever seen in my life.I've seen it many times.I've watched it over and over.
18596,"This movie's so bad it's funny, but it's so bad it's so bad it's so bad it's good"
18597,One of the best adventure movies of all time...........
18598,"Imax at it's very best! The music, cinematography and sound are absolutely stunning as you might expect from an Imax production. Imax lends just the right magic to make car construction entertaining and fascinating."
18599,"This is a great documentary film. Any fan of car racing should own a copy of this outstanding film. Director ""Stephen Low"" did a great job,as well as the main stars of the film, Father & Son, Mario & Michael"
18600,"An excellent documentary, packed with racing action beautiful pictures and a great story. The IMAX Cameras give you a very wide perspective, as a DVD movie it is perfect."
18601,"A great documentary on the world of Indy Car racing. The photography is simply outstanding. The scene were Mario Andretti drives the old racing roadster down the New England street lined with the ancient maples, leaves blown to the side by the speed"
18602,A must see for anyone who loves cars and the history of the indy car culture. A must see for anyone who loves cars and the history of the indy car culture.
18603,"A great demo of your new DVD / bigscreen / 5.1 channel sound system. The IMAX camera puts you right in the race car, where you cruise around various tracks at high speed, reminiscent of the driving sequences in Grand Prix (if only"
18604,"Light, funny, and very well observed - not what you might expect from a movie about bikers and drugs. A delight on all fronts, and difficult to criticise, though I thought the last two scenes were a bit lame."
18605,One of the best motorcycle movies i've seen in a long time.........
18606,"A fun, feel-good film with a sense of humour that will make you laugh out loud and make you want to watch it over and over again!"
18607,A must see for all those with a sense of humour!! brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
18608,"A great British film. A cleverly observed script with many quotable lines, which captures perfectly what magic mushrooms can do to a man over a weekend. Like the weed in the Welsh fields: it's a grower!"
18609,"This is a great film, particularly for those who've dabbled in psychoactive substances in the past. A personal favourite is the brilliant scene in the Welsh corner shop, buying munchies while tripping on'shrooms."
18610,"Freebird is the perfect marriage of road trip comedy, gang caper, ""stoner"" film and feel-good British movie.brbr It is the brilliant lead characters that set this movie apart from other films in this genre"
18611,What a class bit of British cinema! It's about time. And a side splitting comedy to boot!brbrAnyone searching to relive a bit of freedom from their misspent youth this road movie will prove the ticket
18612,"One of the best films i've seen in a long, long time (and i've watched it a couple of times on DVD)..."
18613,I was pleasantly surprised by the film. Let's face it; the premise doesn't sound particularly appealing when having to hand over money for a...
18614,"I was in the film too, but i don't know if they actually put this scene in. I was asked to run in and shout Go!"
18615,A great British Indy movie! Fantastic chemistry between the 3 main characters make for some hilarious drug-fuelled set pieces that Cheech and Chong would be proud of
18616,"Great film, well written, realistic characters!<n>I have seen the freebird movie and think its great! its laid back fun, about time the British film industry came through with something entertaining!! its good how the guy who met"

18626,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time."
18627,One of Antonioni's best films. Why isn't this out on DVD? I'd like to see it on the big screen again!
18628,"""Zabriskie Point"" in its original, breathtaking format, and broke into thunderous applause at the end. The audience was all the more appreciative of viewing ""Zabriskie Point"" in its original, breathtaking format"
18629,"The best Antonioni film I've ever seen, and I'm not just saying that because I'm an Antonioni fan. It's the best film I've ever seen."
18630,"One of Antonioni's better films, but it's not quite as good as Blow-Up or The Eclipse...."
18631,"One of Antonioni's best films, and one of his best films of the 60s, in its own way. Well worth seeking out, and one of those key films of the 60s that demands a DVD restoration/release."
18632,"One of Antonioni's best, if not his best, movies. A must-see for any Antonioni fan. A must-see for anyone who's ever seen L'Eclisse or La Notte."
18633,"""Zabriskie Point"" has a powerful philosophical ending. But that ending has meaning only if you watch the movie from the beginning.""Zabriskie Point"""
18634,"One of the best films of the 60's, but not as good as it could have been......"
18635,"Time marches on and time has been kind to ZP and time has been a teacher to me. And ZP is it's own ""experience""and is only really linked to BLOWUP through its creator, the late, Mr"
18636,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it's Antonioni. It's the best film I've ever seen."
18637,"One of Antonioni's best, but not as good as ""Blow-Up"" or ""Zabriskie Point"", but still worth a look"
18638,"If you've experienced the counter-cultural idealism of the 60's, this is a film you'll want to see again and again."
18639,"A beautiful new print of ""Zabriskie Point"" is playing in Paris and seems to be doing well in the Latin Quarter. Let's hope that the new print means that a DVD with some insightful ""extras"" will be"
18640,ZP is deeply related to that youth dream represented by the hippie movement.The college debate in the beginning of the movie states the cultural situation that gives birth to that movement.
18641,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time."
18642,"What we see is our imagination of people that are abstractions to us- no one we know, but we've doubtless heard of them in a book or on TV or somewhere"
18643,"This movie is one of the masterpieces from Mr. Antonioni. It is about youth, distraction, happiness, alienation, materialism, honor, corruption. And it is like everything else from great Italian director -true art."
18644,"I liked this movie. It was pretty cool. It has it all: cars, gun shooting, fighting, and even a token girl. I wasn t always thinking ""Is this possible?"" or tramp like that. 9 in 10"
18645,"The movie was a big Car Commercial. :-)brbr But who cares? I went to the theater to view the Shelby Cobra, Angelina & Cage"
18646,A pleasant surprise! I expected a further downgrade along the line: The Rock (9)-->Con Air (7)-->Armaggeddon (4). Especially for such an overhyped film
18647,"Campy and dark, this is great ol skool kung fu!! Carter Wong plays a noble hero on a quest for a book of healing which leads him seeking ultimate vengeance!"
18648,"Not quite as good as the original, but still a good film. I liked it a lot. I rate it highly cos of all the remakes of old 50's Sci Fi, this one came off well. I actually enjoyed"
18649,A great spoof of the Alien Invaders of the 50's and 60's.......
18650,Nick and Kelly are ready to be married but Travis (Kelly's dog) leads Nick to a strange blue wall that will change the honeymoon for Kelly. Richard Burgi and Susan Walters play Nick and Kelly and make a good couple.
18651,"A time capsule of a ""forgotten people"" and how they lived during what we in the West knew as the ""roaring twenties""<n>The film is probably of more value to the anthropologist than the casual viewer in search of a good evening"
18652,"The first collaboration between Schoedsack & Cooper is a compelling documentary on the migration of the Bakhtiari tribe of Persia. Twice a year, more than 50,000 people and half a million animals cross rivers and mountains to get to pasture."
18653,"One of the best documentaries I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time."
18654,"One of the best films ever made about the Middle East, and one of the best films ever made about the Middle East, and one of the best films ever made about the Middle East."
18655,"This was soul-provoking! I am an Iranian, and living in th 21st century, I didn't know that such big tribes have been living in such conditions at the time of my grandfather!"
18656,A wonderful film with some truly amazing shots and an incredible story. brbrI thought it was a wonderful film with some truly amazing shots and an incredible story. brbrI think it absolutely incredible for it'
18657,"One of the best documentary's I've seen in a long time - if not for the inter-titles, I'd give it 5 stars."
18658,This documentary is absolutely amazing. I saw it tonight on Turner Classic Movie channel. I think I will see if I can order a copy of it on DVD
18659,Why did they do it? Better them than I! Better them than I! Better them than I! Better them than I! Better them than I!
18660,This film shows peoples in the middle of the hottest 2 days in Austria. It show peoples humiliating other peoples and being cruel to other peoples.
18661,"Not for the faint of heart. It's like 'Happiness' with explicit sex and a less optimistic view of humanity. There's animal poisoning, a strip-tease from a senior citizen, an orgy'esque' bat"
18662,"The most beautiful scene: The old Viennese man, watching his old girl dancing 'the oriental way', as he is calling it. I think everybody who finds this scene ugly lacks a sense of beauty and should ask themselves what it is"
18663,"One of the best films I ve seen in a long time, and one of the best films I ve seen in a long time."
18664,"'Dog Days' is a fascinating character study. It's like CRASH tripping on a bad dose of heroin, but not really. It's an Austrian film following the lives of several depressed, deranged and annoying people and their abusive"
18665,"Seidl's film is a warning about the terrible state of human relationships so brutally revealed in Hundstage. And if the viewer does not succumb to the reasons for this evil transformation, Seidl has achieved his goal."
18666,"An ugly and unnerving study of life in a dreary suburb of Vienna.<n>The film veers away from normal types and presents us with characters that are best described as ""extremes"""
18667,"It's not bad, it's not bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it"
18668,"Porn industry has to do its business, somewhere unreported domestic violence has to take place, somewhere hopes have to shatter. I sure do know such people."
18669,"If you're not 100% sure of your mental stability, don't watch this film. It's not a brilliant idea to watch Hundstage if you're not 100% sure of your mental stability."
18670,"""Hundstage"" is one of the best austrian films in the past years. i've to say that this is one of the best and most rewarding austrian films in the past years."
18671,"You see 'em in the park, standing at the opposite street corner, queuing in the same line. Maybe you meet 'em in a bar or a disco you may visit. You'll try to get away - but you cannot."
18672,"a movie about the cruelty of this world. I found it liberating, as only truth can be. The voice of the character played by Maria Hofsttter is particularly hard to duplicate by a dubber."
18673,"""Dog Days"" is about how women are treated in (a male) society. Probably a helpful tool in teaching even the less sensitive spectator what goes wrong - due to good visualization"
18674,this movie kicks ass......................
18675,One of the most accurate films i've ever seen describing life in modern cities. It's very harsh and cruel at some points and sadly it's very close to reality.
18676,A movie/documentary about different people in Austria on the hottest weekend of the year. It follows what they are doing and maybe more what they are not doing.
18677,"Uncompromising look at a suburb in 21st century Vienna mixing the stories of six groups of characters by former documentary maker U.Seidl is a provocative, minimalistic and intense piece of observation cinema"
18678,What hath the Marshall Plan and the EU wrought? What hath the Marshall Plan and the EU wrought? What hath the Marshall Plan and the EU wrought? What hath the Marshall Plan and the EU wrought?
18679,"Pure classic silliness at its best. Everyone and everything is once again just so enjoyable. But with Astaire and Rogers, we just know it's got to work."
18680,One of the best Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers films of the A-R era.......
18681,This is my all-time favorite Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers film. Not to mention this film contains some of the best songs recorded by the two; like I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket and Let's Face
18682,One of the great romantic numbers ever written for the screen. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dance to it. Let's Face the Music and Dance.
18683,"One of the best of the Fred Astaire and Giner Rogers films. Great music by Irving Berlin. Solid support from Randolph Scott, Harriet Nelson, Lucille Ball, Betty Grable, Frank Jenks, and Astrid Allwyn."
18684,"One of the best films of the 20th century, and one of the best movies of all time, in a very different time period......"
18685,Astaire/Rogers at their best in 'Follow The Fleet'<n>Astaire/Rogers at their best in 'I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket' and 'Let's Face the Music and Dance
18686,One of the best of Irving Berlin's 'The Music and Dance' films...but not as good as 'Top Hat' or 'I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket'
18687,"Charming, witty, frothy RKO musical with Astaire and Rogers, followed by ""Face the music and dance"" and ""Face the music and dance"""
18688,One of the lesser of the Astaire/Rogers musicals. It's just very poorly plotted and paced. This is partly due to the secondary romance between Randolph Scott and Harriet Hilliard.
18689,"Astaire and Rogers at the height of their popularity. In 1936 Americans thought of the Navy as a place for song and dance. The plot is decent, but who cares... By the way, notice the cameo roles for Betty Grable"
18690,The Best Of The Astaire-Rogers Series - And It's Not The Best Of The Astaire-Rogers Series - But It's The Best Of The Astaire-Rogers Series
18691,"Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in ""Let Yourself Go""<n>Randolph Scott as ""Bilge"" Smith and Harriet Hilliard as ""Connie"""
18692,"It's hard to watch an older film, but it's worth it for the dancing!              "
18693,"Why all the negative comments about Randolph Scott? He adds to this movie, he doesn't detract from it. He has a winning personality and a great smile."
18694,"""Let's Face the Music and Dance"" is one of the most achingly beautiful songs ever written and executed by Rogers and Astaire. It is truly to be treasured and watched again and again."
18695,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Fred and Ginger are always a pleasure to watch. Seeing ""Lucy"" and Betty Grable before they hit the big time, is fun to watch."
18696,"""Women don't interest me, sister"" -- Astaire and Scott in ""Follow the Fleet""<n>""Let Yourself Go"" is the most wildly exuberant dance number I've ever seen."
18697,"One of the best Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers films ever made. Excellent musical numbers, good support from Randolph Scott, Betty Grable and Lucille Ball make memorable early screen performances."
18698,Astaire and Rogers create a romantic comedy that incorporates relevant situations to society at the time it was made.<n>The plot relies heavily on layered story lines between the two sets of main characters to create a satisfying romantic comedy.
18699,"Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers at their best in ""Follow the Fleet""<n>Astaire tries to break free from his typical rich-man-about-town persona"
18700,"Not as good as other Astaire/Rogers films, but still fun to watch...but not as good as TOP HAT or SHALL WE DANCE"
18701,"Astaire and Rogers shine in ""Follow the Fleet""<n>""Follow the Fleet"" doesn't have a great plot, but it does have great music"
18702,"One of the best Astaire-Rogers movies I've ever seen. The dancing is wonderful. The story line isn't the best, but the dances are wonderful."
18703,"One of Astaire and Rogers' best performances together, but not as good as 'Top Hat' or 'Swing Time'<n>""Let's Face Music and Dance"" is one of the best songs I've ever seen!"
18704,"One of the best movies of the 1930's, and one of the best movies of the 1950's, and one of the best movies of the 60's"
18705,"A surprising blend of film noir and hardboiled spy thriller. Hal Hartley creates a smart, sexy tale of espionage with tongue just barely planted in cheek."
18706,"One of the better sequels I've seen in a long time, but it's not quite as good as the first...and it's not quite as good as the first."
18707,"Parker Posey, Thomas Jay Ryan, James Urbaniak, &amp; Hal Hartley in a different sort of dark comedy, this one's laced with espionage! Henry may have been an international spy - and possible double, or even triple,"
18708,Hal Hartley's best work to date! brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
18709,"Hal Hartley's ""Fay Grim"" is an excellent sequel to 1997's ""Henry Fool."" Parker Posey steals the show as Fay Grim, but the plot is completely different."
18710,"Fay Grim is hard to sit through but Parker Posey is the only actress who could take this story and run with it. She's at once touching,funny, cunning. The supporting actors commit to it as well."
18711,"Not as good as Henry Fool, but still a good film for new fans of Hartley's work.<n>Not as good as Henry Fool, but still a good film"
18712,"Posey's best performance in a long time, but it's not enough to make this film a must-see........"
18713,"""Fay Grim"" is a sequel to ""Henry Fool"", and it's quite good. Maybe it doesn't quite reach the original's quality, but it takes a good look at what's going on in the world"
18714,"Fay Grim is an excellent follow-up to Hal Hartley's Henry Fool, but it's not as good as the first one...."
18715,"Henry Fool is a better film. But this is the perfect way to follow-up a film like 'Henry Fool.' To take Henry very seriously, his 'lies' and his mysterious aura"
18716,"Not as good as Hartley's Henry Fool, but not as bad as Hartley's Henry Fool... but not as bad as Hartley's Henry Fool..."
18717,"Hal Hartley's forte is mystery/espionage with wispy comedy.<n>Parker Posey stars as Fay Grim, abandoned wife of Henry Fool and mother to Henry's only son Ned."
18718,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I'm a fan of Parker Posey's acting, but Fay Grim is the best."
18719,"Parker Posey at her best as Fay Grim, the sister of Simon Grim........."
18720,"One of the funniest films I've seen in many years. If you don't see the humor of the grocery bag carries from the street to a church, to her brother's publisher's office, to her son's"
18721,One of the Best Sequels to a Brilliant Indie Film : : :.......
18722,"Parker Posey, Jeff Goldblum, Hal Hartley, Liam Aiken, Saffron Burrows, &amp; Co.<n>""What's in the frame and what's out?"""
18723,"One of the best films I've seen this year, and I'm not just saying that because it's the sequel to the best film I've ever seen."
18724,Hal Hartley's 'Fay Grim' is a great sequel to his 1998 film 'Henry Foole'. Parker Posey does a great job as Fay Grim.
18725,"Hartley's best film to date, but it's not quite as good as he'd like it to be.<n>Parker Posey, Jeff Goldblum, Saffron Burrows, James Urbaniak, Carl Montgomery and Elina"
18726,"Hal Hartley's ""Syriana"" is a filmic fusion of his own style and the world's..<n>Parker Posey is in full bloom here, still with us and more ripe and gorgeous than before."
18727,"The Vanities, on its opening night, plays on to an unknowing audience. Odd combination of musical and murder mystery is worth a look for its cast, its production numbers, and the sheer novelty of the film"
18728,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen, but it's worth it for the time it took to get it made......."
18729,"A BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT, BRILL"
18730,One of the only early musicals to feature such a mix--and the costumes leave nothing to the imagination. And I believe this is one of the only early musicals to feature such a mix--and the costumes leave nothing to the imagination
18731,"Duke Ellington's ""Rhapsody"" was the highlight of this mostly overlong murder mystery-musical comedy mixture. Worth a look for any film buff interested in this sort of thing."
18732,"Big budget, big cast, big budget, big budget, big budget, big budget, big budget, big budget, big budget, big budget, big budget, big budget, big budget, big budget, big budget, big budget,"
18733,Long on atmosphere and character but short on suspense and plausibility.<n>Musical numbers are staged as if they could actually have fit into a standard proscenium theatre space.
18734,"A very enjoyable film, providing you know how to watch old musicals / mysteries. It may not come close to Agatha Christie or even Thin Man mysteries as a film noir, but it's much more interesting than your typical ""boy meets girl"
18735,A fun movie of the sort they don't make any more. Its a fun movie of the sort they don't make any more. I don't think Spike Jones and His City Slickers ever played it that much.
18736,"""Cocktails for Two"", ""Sweet Marijauna"", ""Sweet Marijauna"", ""Cocktails for Two"", ""Cocktails for Two"""
18737,"Good musical numbers, but the drama is unconvincing and faked - three murders is too many and have minimal emotional impact on the characters. This is where this movie could have been a lot better."
18738,One of the few comic book adaptations to make it to the big screen.........
18739,"The Spirit was a great TV movie, but it's not available on DVD yet. Maybe with Frank Miller's big-screen version, more people will be able to see this rare gem of Spirit history."
18740,"This was a great example of ""camp"", that was also ""underplayed"", by both the actor and actress. This was a great example of ""camp"", that was also ""underplayed"", by both the actor and"
18741,"Great film, but not as good as Rohinton Mistry's book, ""Such a Long Journey"", but still a great film.."
18742,"A great film. The acting - from the doctor to the pavement artist to the head prostitute, with very few exceptions, was wonderful; i thought soni razdan(mrs.noble) and vrajesh hirjee("
18743,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best films I've seen in a long time."
18744,"Such a Long Journey is a fine little movie, but if you want to see it, then good luck finding it. It has received very little release."
18745,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more than once, and it's still the best movie I've seen in a long time."
18746,This is a movie to be seen on the big screen. Don't be put off by the title and plot summary - this is a movie to be seen on the big screen. We have much to learn from it.
18747,Aileen Gonsalves is in this film playing a secretary at the main character's bank. She has a lovely scene with Roshan Seth in a restaurant
18748,"""Such a Long Journey"" is a well crafted film, a good shoot, and a showcase for some good performances. However, the story is such a jumble of subplots and peculiar characters that it becomes a sort of Jack of all plots"
18749,"The Bill was a cultural fountain from which a beautiful rainbow-haze of socio-introspection emerged, inspiring such famed derivatives as Cop Land, The Departed, The Godfather 3, and most recently, The Wire"
18750,"The Bill is one of the best programmes I've seen in a long time, and I don't think I've missed it in a long time."
18751,"A bit too much story and too many 'depraved' scenes, but it's quite a ride. Unfortunately there is a bit too much story and at times this becomes like a travelogue as our heroine searches the sleaze"
18752,"One of the few films where I consider the film rendition to be an improvement on the original book. The story is clear, accessible, amusing and interesting and the musical numbers are without a doubt exceptional."
18753,One of my favorite movies of all time. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it
18754,"Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fun-filled fantasy adventure for kids, starring Angela Lansbury as an apprentice witch who, with the help of three evacuee children and a 'Professor of Witchcraft'"
18755,Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a great movie. I wish they would have left the original version on the DVD. It could have been cut down to the orginal length. It was too long and dragged the movie along.
18756,"Great music, bad story, bad animation, bad acting, bad acting, bad acting, bad acting, bad animation, bad acting, bad acting, bad acting, bad acting, bad acting, bad acting, bad acting, bad acting,"
18757,"I am still a child inside,and this movie appeals to my inner child like no other. This movie is my definite favorite of all times. I hope that all children will be able to watch this classic and be swept away,and transported"
18758,One of the best non-animated movies I've seen in a long time. I've watched it several times with my 3 year old son.
18759,The 30th aniversy of Disney's Beauty and the Beast is the best movie I've ever seen. The 30th aniversy of this movie DVD is better than the original.
18760,"""Overallknobs and Broomsticks"" is a magical adventure film with a certain charm, despite not being one of the best Disney works. It has a generally good story, nice songs, good characters, magical and delightful special effects,"
18761,"A Fine Sequel to MARY POPPINS, and Angela Lansbury's first musical film lead.<n>A Fine Sequel to MARY POPPINS, and Angela Lansbury's sole musical film lead."
18762,Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fine fantasy film that still holds up well after almost 40 years. Imagine what it would be like with computer generated graphics.
18763,One of my all-time favorite Disney's! Remake it! Remake it! Remake it! Remake it! Remake it! Remake it! Remake it! Remake it! Remake it! Re
18764,"""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" is one of the movies I can remember seeing this way.brbr Angela Lansbury never put her name to anything that wasn't at least competent, and she's winning here"
18765,"Better than Bedknobs and Broomsticks, but not as good as Bedknobs and Broomsticks, but better than Bedknobs and Broomsticks"
18766,"Bedknobs is a good movie, but the remastered scenes are a little odd. I'm not sure what's going on with the soundtrack."
18767,DAVID TOMLINSON IS A MASTERPIECE OF THE WORLD WAR II........
18768,Bedknobs and Broomsticks is one of the most delightful movies you'll ever see as a kid. It's the unforgettable movie about two adults and two spunky kids on an adventure for fun.
18769,"This is a very different story to Mary Poppins and Angela Lansbury delivers a wonderful performance. The animation is delightful, much better than Pixar which I find grotesque. A warm happy film and its a wonder its not done on stage."
18770,"Not as good as Mary Poppins, but still a lovely film. Angela Lansbury is wonderful as Engletine Price, and David Tomlinson is adorable as Mr. Brown."
18771,"Not as good as I thought it would be, but still a fun movie for the whole family......"
18772,"A pleasant account of a true story, but not the best movie I've ever seen, but it was worth the $8 (which can't be said for many movies these days)"
18773,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it stars Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding Jr."
18774,"""Men of Honor"" is a very good movie, but it's not quite as good as ""Navy Diver"" but it's still good."
18775,"This is a film that should be seen by all of us, even if you don't know what it is about. It should be seen by all of us."
18776,"One of the best movies i've ever seen.Carl Brashear is an amazing character to play.De Niro,who is a living legend gives THAT SOMETHING to the movie.Hated his character in movie,but he gives so much"
18777,"An inspirational movie, showing that determination can overcome all odds. An inspirational movie, showing that determination can overcome all odds. An inspirational movie, showing that determination can overcome all odds."
18778,"A must see for independant movie fans, but also holds up well against mainstream movies. I think we have the makings of the next Woody Allen orbrbrTrentin Tarrentino here."
18779,One of the best B&W films I've seen in a long time. brbr br br br br br br br br 
18780,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more than once, and I've seen it more than once."
18781,"Surprisingly well made little movie. For a low budget movie, very well made. Plot is slow to unravel. Cast is excellent especially Elizabeth Van Meter as the girlfriend with Tourette's Syndrome."
18782,"Passing stones definitely one of the best comedy independent films ever. You must have a sense of humor to fully enjoy this one. My favorite character in this film would have to be the sister/crack addict with turret's syndrome,her sudden"
18783,"It's officially Disney's first animated sci-fi adventure. Evidently, it was also ""too cryptic"" according to some critics after the fact."
18784,"A great movie for the whole family to watch. It's just like the book, but it's a lot better. It's a great movie!"
18785,"Disney's ""Atlantis"" is a bold step, but it's not a Disney film, it's a Disney film. It's a Disney film."
18786,"An excellent rendition of an ancient myth. The animation was somewhat odd, but nothing new from Disney. It was definitely better than expected for a Disney movie with no singing."
18787,"Not as good as it could have been, but still worth a view. brbrThis is, in my opinion, THE BEST Disney Animated Feature Length Film. brbrIt rates a 9.4/10 from..."
18788,"Not the best Disney movie, but it is entertaining and well worth the price of admission. I don't understand the bad reputation this movie has received."
18789,"A very good idea,screenplay was just OK.Could have been better..A new idea about the lost world of Atlantis.Negatives are that I personally feel that this idea had so much more potential than this."
18790,"""Atlantis"" is a new and right step for a Disney feature. It's a good choice to make a film by such a mysterious legend like ""Atlantis"""
18791,"Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a better movie than I thought. I never thought this movie would lead to my expectations. True, this movie started slow, but as the movie wore on it became more to my liking."
18792,"Disney's ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" is a shining gem in the rubble of films produced by the Disney Studios recently. Parents who have had to sit through ""The Jungle Book 2"" or even a Pokemon movie will surely appreciate this"
18793,"It's a great movie, but it's not quite as good as I expected it to be....."

18897,I liked this movie a lot. It's not just a fast car movie. It's a good movie. It's a good movie.
18898,"I loved this film, I know it was fairly far fetched, there is no way that Shelby car could have managed to stay on the road as well as the 540i with all it's traction control and other gizmos but..."

19009,"Best movie I have seen in a long time. It will make you mad because everyone is so mean to Carl Brashear, but in the end it gets better. It is a story of romance, drama, action, and plenty of funny"

19015,Men Of Honor is an inspiring story about people with courage to spare and the ability to change. Robert DeNiro and Cuba Gooding do it again.
19016,"One of the best military films ever made. And it is great because of its focus on values. It's a great human interest story that turns on a commitment to honor, loyalty, love, and determination."

19027,A great example of fine storytelling. The acting is superb. The story is inspiring without being overly manipulative or fake. There were a couple points where they probably made people a tad more good or bad than they really were.
19028,"One of the better Indian movies I have seen lately, instead of crappy song and dance or slum dog movies. All the actors have showed the right emotions at the right intensity with right timing."

19139,I really liked this movie! Even though it wasn't anything like any of the books it still the that classic Nancy Drew style. Pretty much all of the characters were exactly how I pictured them from reading the books.

19143,"I had to go see this movie backwards, didn't expect that much, but hey, I was not deceived, I had a good time.brbrI would say this movie is way a fresh breeze, despite some facts"
19144,"""Nancy Drew"" works both as a mystery and a comedy. It pays homage to the books it was based on and spoofs them at the same time."
19145,Nancy Drew is a role model for young girls to look up to. The movie has relatively few problems for families and I don't think parents will get bored sitting in the theater.
19146,"Emma Roberts is adorable in the title role. (Expect to see more of this next-generation Roberts in the future.) After being over exposed to the likes of Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, and Paris Hilton, it was refreshing to see"
19147,"I liked it, but it wasn't as good as the books, but it still had the right amount of suspense for my children. It had just the right amount of suspense for my children (8 and 10.) There was almost no"
19148,This was a great movie! Even though there was only about 15 people including myself there it was great! My friend and I laughed a lot. There was two middle aged women there and a mid 20 year old there and they seemed to enjoy
19149,I loved this movie!! brbr                   
19150,"A little too simple, Nancy Drew (Emma Roberts) uses IMDb... that's fantastic! I really liked about that part of the movie... and Ned Nickerson (Max Nickerson) seemed really hopeless..."
19151,This is a good movie for kids who play the Nancy Drew games. I think it's a good movie for the whole family. I think it's a good movie.
19152,"I liked it, but if you didn't like it, that's your fault, not my fault, it was cute. Emma Roberts played a good Nancy Drew, even though she isn't quite like the books."
19153,Emma Roberts as Nancy Drew is the real star of this movie. brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
19154,"Not as good as the 1930s, but not as bad as I thought it would be. I liked Emma Roberts in this role, but they gave her a made-for-TV, not theatrical release, script..."
19155,"The Best Documentary I've seen in a long time. I've seen it a few times, but this is the best I've seen in a long time."
19156,"One of Colman's best roles in ""Othello""--and a great supporting cast--if you're a fan of the play."
19157,One of Ronald Colman's Best Performances--and a Film Noir Film Noir Film at it's very best........
19158,One of Ronald Coleman's best roles in a long time. A Double Life is a gem of a movie. Coleman's talent and depth of acting make this a must see.
19159,Excellent film. Too bad they don't make 'em like 'em like 'em used to...... too bad they don't make 'em like they used to...
19160,Coleman at his best in this piece of Noir about an actor who loses himself in his roles. Winters is very impressive as the young woman determined to get away from her squalid life.
19161,Ronald Colman's Oscar-winning performance makes up for any deficiencies with a remarkably-handled Expressionist denouement.<n>The film makes up for any deficiencies with a remarkably-handled Expressionist denouement
19162,One of the best films I've seen in a long time                  
19163,Ronald Colman gives a terrific performance as a stage actor who really gets into his work. When he plays Othello on the stage he takes on the persona with dire results. Good film with a great supporting cast
19164,"Great fun if you just want a stupid film. Not great production value (ok, the sound really sucked) but the performance of Danny Masterson more than makes up for it."
19165,Excellent writing and wild cast. The tech is poor but it's obviously very low budget. Looks like they didn't cut the negative but had to release on a video output. In any case one of the most inventive comedies I'

19170,"I'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I don't think I've seen every episode. Now, in conclusion, I hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good."
19171,"One of my favorite shows in the 80's. After the first season, it started going downhill when they decided to add Jean Bruce Scott to the cast. Deborah Pratt was wonderful and it was fun watching her and Ernest Borgnine's character"
19172,"One of the best action shows of the 80s - but not as good as Knight Rider, Street Hawk or The A-Team..."
19173,"One of the best detective films of the 50's, with curious moral values, also one of Preminger's best... brbrThe film is one of the best detective films of the 50's, with curious"
19174,"One of the finest noirs of the 20th Century, with Andrews at his best.<n>Andrews was the only one of the three protagonists in THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES not nominated for an Academy Award."
19175,Where the Sidewalk Ends is Where the Sidewalk Ends is Where the Sidewalk Ends is Where the Sidewalk Ends is Where the Sidewalk Ends is Where the Sidewalk Ends is Where the Sidewalk Ends is Where the Sidewalk Ends is Where the Sidewalk Ends is Where the Sidewalk
19176,"""Where the Sidewalk Ends"" is one of the best noir films of all time........"
19177,Where the Sidewalk Ends is a gritty film filled with desperate people who solve their problems with their fists or some other weapon. Small-time hoods are a dime-a-dozen and cops routinely beat out crooks.
19178,"One of the best films noirs I've ever seen, and one of the best I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time."
19179,"One of the best film noirs I've seen in a long, long time - and it's not just because it stars Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews!"
19180,"A good entry in the field of noir, forcefully directed by Preminger and nicely played by Andrews and Tierney, despite the slight miscasting of her character."
19181,One of the best film noirs I've ever seen--and it's not just because it stars Dana Andrews and Kirk Douglas. It's one of my all-time favorites.
19182,"""Where the Sidewalk Ends"" is a great film noir, but the ending is a little disappointing......"
19183,"""You don't hate hoods, you liked to beat them up!""<n>""You don't hate hoods, you liked to beat them up!"""
19184,"Otto Preminger's ""Sidewalk"" is a ""clone"" of what a noir should be......"
19185,"A great film noir filled with great characters, story, and picture. Where The Sidewalk Ends is no Laura, but it is a great film noir filled with great characters, story, and picture."
19186,One of Preminger's best noirs...and a great companion-piece to his WHIRLPOOL...a must see for any noir fan!
19187,"Not as good as I thought it would be, but still a good noir film with a couple of great actors...and a good plot.."
19188,"Pretty good film from Preminger; labyrinthine at times, as it explores sets and locales from various angles and perspectives as if it were a nature film on the denizens of the modern city and how they live."
19189,A very well-made film with some excellent character acting that at times is deeply moving - for example the scene with the loyal but unsophisticated sidekick cop and his wife.
19190,"The charm of Otto Preminger's grandiose, visionary film noir is that it has ambiguous intentions. Dana Andrews furnishes a complex character unfolded through his streaks of violence and the hatred that always infests him."
19191,"""Where The Sidewalk Ends"" is a gritty thriller involving a group of interesting and diverse characters and a main protagonist who is the absolute personification of moral ambiguity. Dana Andrews' strained and preoccupied expressions convey his character's perpetually troubled nature and his"
19192,"Dana Andrews, Gene Tierney, Otto Preminger, and Tom Tully.<n>'Where the Sidewalk Ends' was the only film to reunite them after Laura (1944)"
19193,A great example of a simple Film Noir story that is handled exceptionally well--thanks to excellent direction by Otto Preminger. Dana Andrews stars as a hot-headed detective who all too often uses his fists instead of his brains.
19194,"A Turkish Bath sequence in a film noir located in New York in the 50's, that must be a hint at something!<n>The unspoken theme of the movie could very well be that of a man who in order to cover his"
19195,One of the best film noirs I've seen in a long time........
19196,"One of my all-time favorite Preminger films, and one of the best I've seen in a long, long time -- and Dana Andrews is the star."
19197,"Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, who were both so memorable in 1944's ""Laura"" re-teamed for this excellent 1950 film-noir."
19198,"A solid film noir with excellent performances and all the shadowy photography and murky morality we expect from this genre. Of course, the classic noir directed by Preminger and starring Andrews and Tierney is ""Laura."" You'll enjoy this, but you"
19199,One of the best film noirs of the 1950's. Karl Malden shines in the role of the cop torn up by his past and on a path of self-destruction.
19200,"""Where the Sidewalk Ends"" is a good example of what film noir is all about.<n>Andrews is pretty good. He's a kind of Mark MacPherson gone bitter"
19201,Where the Sidewalk Ends is quite a good film-noir crime drama and is shot well in black and white and on location as well. Good parts from all.
19202,"Preminger, Andrews, Malden, Tully, Brand, Tierney, Nolan, Stevens, &amp; Freed in this solid policier.<n>Andrews rises to the challenge with a first-rate characterization that is typically complemented"
19203,"One of the best documentaries I have seen in a long time, and one of the best films I have ever seen about the sport of surfing as well."
19204,A stunning documentary about the history of big-wave surfing in America. Stacy Peralta has followed up Dogtown and Z-Boys with an equally stunning documentary about the history of the big-wave surfing culture in America.
19205,A must see if you're a big-wave surfer or just want to see some of the best footage you've ever surfed in your life.
19206,"One of the best surf movies I've seen in a long, long time - and it's not just about Laird Hamilton, it's about the pioneers of big wave surfing!"
19207,"This was the best documentary I've ever seen!! I just saw Lords of Dogtown and wanted to know more about Stacy Peralta, and was surprised and happy to find out this was one of his films as well. Great Job Stacy!"
19208,I rate this 10 out of 10. Why?brbr* It offers insight into something I barely understand - the surfers surf because it's all they want to do
19209,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because I'm a movie buff. It's because I'm a movie buff."
19210,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time........."
19211,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it a few times, but never as good as this one."
19212,"I'm in awe of the surfers in this film. The idea that Jeff Clark, to all appearances a normal mortal, could get away with riding Maverick's BY HIMSELF is beyond my grasp."
19213,A must see for anyone interested in the evolution of big wave surfing and the people who helped make it possible. Stacy Peralta is true first to the people who lived the story.
19214,One of the best films I've seen in a long time!brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
19215,"Surfing is dangerous, but you have to be brave to do it. You have to adjust to your best and avoid direct strike from the big wave. When you win it, that will obviously bring you huge satisfaction."
19216,"This is the best movie I've seen in a long time. It's awesome. I've never been on a surf board, and it looks so hard, I don't understand how they can stay on them."
19217,"What's missing is a bigger question: ""what is the purpose of life?""<n>I was a surfer in the 1970s, and this film made me feel like I was back in time."
19218,If you like surfing--or even if you don't--this is a wonderful documentary that must be watched. If you like surfing--or even if you don't--this is a wonderful documentary that must be
19219,A fascinating look back at the sport's history. Have I whetted your appetite? Wonderful. Have a great ride. Have a great ride. Have a great ride.
19220,"A fine work of cinema, made by people who care enough to make it art and not just home movies. It is filled with artistic talent, and athletic talent, however trivial you might think surfing to be athletic."
19221,"It's a great story, but it could have been so much more........."
19222,"Not the best, but not the worst, but not the best either. brbrI felt as if at times the story focused too much on the 'proper nouns' of the sport, so to speak: too much on"
19223,"Al Adamson's worst film to date, and it's the worst musical comedy of all time.............."
19224,One of the best shows on ABC's TGIF. I really miss this show. I hope one day ABC brings it back with new episodes. I give this show 10/10 stars.
19225,A trip to a better world... and an inspiration to be better ourselves and a gift intended to bust a smile on our chops... and isn't that what we all need? :)
19226,I liked this TV show because it was it's own thing a girl who is on her sixteenth birthday finds out that she is a witch and her she lives with her aunties in the house and they are both witches as well.
19227,"I love Sabrina! Its one of my fave shows!! My favourite episodes are; the one where she turns Libby into a geek, the first episode, the true love episode and most of the rest from the first series."

19234,"""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch"" is quite moving and very funny, and it's a shame that it took me so long to realize how great it was. I only wish there were some newer episodes that we could all enjoy"
19235,"For the first three seasons, Sabrina was a gem hidden away on TGIF. Each episode had a maniac, zany energy and rapid-fire pacing that overcame the occasional awkward joke."
19236,"I'm curious as to what prompted all of the cast changes - I've seen them described as ""highly publicized,"" and yet a half hours searching efforts on the web have revealed nothing but endless comments on how the early episodes were so"

19240,"One of my favourite programmes of all time, but the last two or three series were a bit predictable......"
19241,"When Sabrina left high school the show just didn't seem right. I still love the old episodes of Sabrina the Teenage Witch, but I think the writers took it too far and should have left it with Sabrina leaving high school."
19242,"I'm still a Sabrina fan! I love Caroline Rhea as ""Hilda"" and later on Morgan! I'll be first in line for the DVD!"
19243,one of the best witch shows ever! but the last few seasons have been terrible. i can't believe it's all gone. i can't believe it's been 7 years!

19311,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time. I've never seen anything like it before. I've seen it with tears in my eyes."
19312,"A film with the power to expand the mind, warm the heart and touch the very soul. ""LOU"" is such a film. I got ""LOU"" from my wife who got it from a neighbor who is in the film business."
19313,"One of the most interesting trailers I've ever seen. It seems very interesting and inspirational. I haven't watched the movie yet, but can't wait to see it!"
19314,"The Groove Tube remains to me an unending burst of positive energy, a movie that 26 years after my initial viewing, still brings me real joy! Definitely dated now, but at the time The Groove Tube was irreverent, bold, shameless and hysterically"
19315,One of the few things I remember about the 70's was the very first hippie and hip social satire as seen from a totally 'underground' or counter-culture perspective..The Groove Tube.
19316,One of the best TV-spoofing movies I've ever seen........
19317,"Groove Tube looks a lot like actual TV today! I still can't hear Curtis Mayfield's ""Move On Up"" without thinking of naked dancing hitchhiking hippies"
19318,"One of those weird, funny movies that seemed to influence other like films (vision, Kentucky Fried Movie) and possibly Saturday Night Live (which made Chevy that show's first star)"
19319,"""The Groove Tube"" was fresh, new, and really 'got' the humor of the times. It offered a 'hip generation', humor that wasn't available in any other format/medium."""
19320,One of the best things to come along in 1972 was Groove Tube. I highly recommend this vid. I've told my 13 year old son about Koko the clown- He can't wait to get a copy!
19321,"A series of vignettes, most of them spoofing television of the 1970's, but also with some digs at the government and corporate America. One of the longest segments, ""The Dealers"" is not that funny to me and I don'"
19322,"best movie ever!!!!! this movie broke my ribs just by the force of laughter, but it was well worth it. i don't intend to do a summary of this excellent movie, just go see it if you have the chance."
19323,"Groove Tube hits and misses a lot. Overall, I do really like this movie. Unfortunately, a couple of the segments are totally boring. A few really great clips make up for this. A few really great clips make up for this."
19324,"The art-house crowd had the time of their cinematic lives. It's tasteless, groovy and very funny in a sixties kind of way. The Kraft Kitchen recipe sketch had them laughing like maniacs."
19325,"I laughed real hard throughout the whole movie. It's amazing that ""The Groove Tube"" is possibly the granddaddy, yet raunchiest, of all comedic skit movies.This is the way I enjoy watching TV without being bored"
19326,The Granddaddy of Carlin's Comedic Satires..........
19327,"One of the funniest films I've seen in a long, long time, and I've been waiting for it to come out on DVD. I can't believe it's been so long since I've seen it."
19328,"One of the funniest things I've seen in a long, long, long, long, long time...even if it's 30 years later!"
19329,"It could have been better, but at least it's not raunchy........"
19330,"One of the best comedies of all time, and one of the best in the history of the genre......"
19331,"It's pretty funny and quite graphic. It's just like Kentucky Fried Movie except not as funny. Love the fingers, easy lube, and I'm da f**kin' president parts. Dealers skit is pretty cool too"
19332,"A great suspense movie with terrific slow camera-work adding to the dramatics makes this a treat to watch and enjoy. Director-writer Brian de Palma does a super Hitchcock-imitation (many called it a ""ripoff"") with this"
19333,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time. I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once."

19338,"""Dressed To Kill"", is one of the best thrillers ever made. Its dealings with sex and violence make this a film for adults. Brian De Palma, once again, proves why no other director can match his use of the camera"
19339,One of the Best Horror/Thriller Films Ever Made!.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
19340,"""Dressed to Kill"" has been more or less forgotten in critical circles in the past 20 years, but it is a true American classic, a film which is much more than just a..."

19344,"One of De Palma's best, but it's not quite as good as he'd like it to be.<n>De Palma's technique had hit its high maturity by the time of this film"
19345,A good psychological murder mystery but not as good as I thought it would be........
19346,"Good, but too bad certain things prevent it from being a classic. It's just too bad certain things, quite obvious, prevent it from being a classic."
19347,"A very silly movie, but the whole package just, well, works. Despite its many, many flaws, the whole package just, well, works."
19348,"A very good psychological horror/suspense film,but the unrated version is very graphic.it's not as good as the ""R"" rated version."
19349,One of the best films I've seen in a long time. Angie Dickinson's performance is outstanding. A must see for anyone who loves film.

19351,"""Dressed to Kill"" is DePalma's best film, a thrill ride of suspense, humor and style that remains unrivaled today. DePalma has a bum rap in Hollywood, as most people claim that he rips off Alfred"
19352,"""Dressed to Kill"" is De Palma's most well-known Hitchcockian film.<n>""Dressed to Kill"" may not be a complete original, but it's definitely worth your time."
19353,"De Palma's ""Psycho"" is a carbon copy, but he does provide a genuinely terrifying climax. His ""Blow Out"", made the next year, was an improvement."
19354,One of Brian De Palma's best but isn't one of his best.<n>It's a pretty good movie but isn't one of De Palma's best

19385,"The first half drags on a bit, while the second half is much more gripping. I think they should have proportioned the movie more like Capote did his book..."
19386,"It's too bad that prosecutors don't quote the Bible today. Did anybody ever hear of John Jay, the first Supreme Court justice in the history of this country? He said that the Bible is the best of all books."
19387,"The 1967 In Cold Blood was perhaps more like ""the real thing"" (Think about it: would we really want to see the real thing?), but it was black and white in a color world"

19391,"Don't let my constructive criticism stop you from buying and watching this Romy Schneider classic. This movie was shot in a lower budget,probably against the will of Ernest Marishka, so he had to make due."

19444,A very interesting and touching story but it left me confused. Maybe that was the point of the film. I did like the film and Wil Smith can wrack up another good film choice.

19472,One of the best sci fi shows I've seen in a long time........
19473,I have waited for it to come. Quite a few people have really brilliantly spoken of the pilot. On the other hand I'm not quite sure to understand the detractors who claim themselves to be BSG fans and not like the pilot.
19474,"Im addicted to Caprica, because it's a really good prequel series to Battlestar Galactica. It really has a slow pace start, but surely to pick up soon after new episodes continue to air."
19475,I'm glad I decided to watch Caprica Rebirth instead of BSG. I think this is a promising show and the only side effect it had on me is that now I want to watch BSG as well.
19476,This is a show that requires a bit of thought from its audience and that is always a good thing. You kind of have to wrap your head around certain aspects of the show...
19477,"Caprica is one of the best Sci-Fi shows I've seen in a long, long time! I can't wait to watch it again!"
19478,One of my all time favourite TV series. I was lucky enough to start watching it as the series came to it's final season. It was a marathon from start to finish for me and what an incredible ride it was!

19480,One of the best Sci-Fi shows I've seen in a long time. It's not just for Battle-star Gallactica fans.
19481,One of the best Sci-Fi pilots I've seen in a long time & it's not just for BSG fans. It's for everyone.

19486,"How does a relationship survive when your girlfriend is codependent, clinging, needy, jealous..<n>and has powers far beyond those of mortal women?"
19487,"""My Super Ex-Girlfriend"" is fun and funny, but it could have been a lot better. ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend"" is also a victim of bad timing, coming on the tail end of ""Superman Returns"""
19488,"A big surprise, probably because I was expecting it to suck. The reviews were pretty dismissive of it, even though they all seemed to agree that the concept was golden"
19489,"My Super Ex Girlfriend turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me, I was really expecting a horrible movie that would probably be stupid and predictable. But this movie did have so many wonderful laughs and a fun plot that anyone could get a kick"

19493,"Not as bad as I thought it would be, but not as good as I thought it would be......"
19494,My Super Ex-Girlfriend is an entertaining movie no more no less. brbrThe story is quiet simple. brbrI give this movie a 7 out of 10 and recommend it to anybody who likes a
19495,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time...and it's not just because it's cute...it's because it's sexy!
19496,My Super X-Girlfriend is one hell of a roller coaster ride. The special effects were excellent and the costumes Uma Thurman wore were hubba buba.
19497,One of the funniest movies I've seen in years. Not since My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2002 has the laughter been as spontaneous and intense. Easily has intricate as last year's Mr. and Mrs. Smith in its use of parody
19498,"One of those movies that makes better trailers than full-length feature films. The concept was really cool and different, the humor was unique, I just felt there were missed opportunities to put the ""punch"" into this movie."
19499,"""My Super Ex-Girlfriend"" is a romantic comedy-adventure with many hilarious moments and is very entertaining. Luke Wilson is great in the role of an idiot, Anna Farris is extremely sexy as usual, and Uma Thurman is great"
19500,I've been hooked since the first episode!! I've watched 72 episodes in 3 weeks. That's 72 forty minute episodes!!! I will say that finding out what happens next is easier on DVD than waiting an entire week.
19501,"The first episode of ""24"" is a promising beginning of a successful series, introducing Jack Bauer. This is the first time that I have watched this show and I confess that I liked what I have seen: a complex and dramatic story,"
19502,"""Addictive"" is an adjective I've heard many times when talking of certain TV shows. Most recently, dramas like Lost, Heroes and Prison Break have earned that description."
19503,"One of the best ""24"" episodes I've ever seen. One of the best episodes I've ever seen. One of the best of it's kind."
19504,"24 is the best television show!!!!! It's an incredible TV series with an incredible suspense, excellent plots and unforgettable characters. And the first episode of all is my best evidence."

19514,One of the best westerns of the early '50's. James Stewart is the star of this one. A great cast supports Stewart here. Shelley Winters seems miscast here and the purpose of her role is rather obscure.
19515,One of the best westerns I've seen in a long time. Jimmy Stewart does an excellent job. Stephen McNalley and John McIntire steal the movie with their portrayal of two bad guys involved in a high stakes poker game
19516,A classic western tale of revenge and the Winchester Rifle. Stewart is it goes without saying excellent adding some cold hard obsession to his usual laid back cowboy. The story follows the fate of a Winchester rifle and its owners after being won in a competition
19517,"Winchester '73 is a great story, and that's what I like about it. It's not your everyday western--it uses a rifle, which passes hands from various characters--as a mechanism for telling the story about"
19518,"James Stewart and Anthony Mann's ""Winchester '73"" is one of the best westerns of the 1950's......."
19519,More like modern-day gangsters than old-fashioned cowboys. Shelley Winters plays a woman of questionable virtue who is headed for a ranch with a man (Charles Drake) she may marry.

19521,"One of the best westerns of the '40's/'50's, if not the '50's. James Stewart is the star."
19522,One of the best westerns I've seen in a long time.........
19523,One-in-a-thousand guns pass through the hands of colorful owners.<n>The film's conflation of fiction and history produces a breezy pace and an ambivalent tone brilliantly in step with Mann's compositionally rigorous film-
19524,"One of the greatest westerns of all time! But this one, unlike many others, does not deal with the nature, horses, shootouts, etc."
19525,"A fine example of the western genre's esoteric themes and symbols. brbrA fine example of the western genre, and ancient mythological themes. brbrThere is also a tacit theme of rape present in"
19526,One of the best westerns of the 1950's.Stewart is the right man to play the lead. Shelley Winters plays Lola Manners and she's great as always.Dan Duryea is terrific at the part of Waco Johnnie

19528,One of the best Westerns I've seen in a long time! James Stewart is at his best! Will Geer's Earp is un-Earp-like!
19529,One of the best westerns of the 20th century. James Stewart is the star of the film.The story is based on real events.The winner was a Winchester 73 model 1873 with ability shoot 17 cartridges caliber 44/40 in few seconds
19530,A great western with excellent acting and a great story. The DVD is in beautifull black and white with outstanding cinematography. If you like westerns or James Stewart this film is not to be missed.

19533,"A very enjoyable film that features characters who do bad things and who let emotions like anger and a desire for vengeance bubble over. I've seen this film several times, and always watch when it's on AMC or cable. Highly recommended"
19534,"""The Gun That Won The West"" - James Stewart, Anthony Mann, &amp; Fritz Lang.<n>Winchester 73 is a benchmark for what became known as the so-called ""psychological Western"""

19536,"One of the best movies of all time, but it's still viewed as just another funny picture......"
19537,"One of Richard Dreyfuss's greatest performances. Also, this movie is funny, yet has a serious side as well. What is especially intriguing about this movie is the character Madonna, who is the dictator's mistress."

19542,This movie is so wonderful! It reminded me very much of Fried Green Tomatoes At The Whistlestop Cafe. brbrThe story goes back in time and at the end of the movie we see what the connections are.
19543,"One of the best movies I have seen in a long time..and it's not based off of a book, it's based off of a screenplay."

19547,"A Disney movie that dares to do something different should at least be awarded for effort. ""Holes"" doesn't make the same mistakes as one would expect from a Disney movie about troubled teenagers put in a camp."
19548,Disney's first success is re-creating the novel's environments so convincingly - the set design is superb and without gloss. The other plus is in the casting.

19550,"A great film, but a bit dodgy in some parts.........."
19551,One of the few movies that isn't too cheesy and isn't aimed towards the teen audience. I wish Disney would make more movies like this.

19560,Very interesting and well done story line. Best of all it left out the usual sex and violence (they're getting old) inserted in many movies. The movie was well done in its flashbacks to days gone by in that area of the

19568,John Thaw and Nick Robinson follow in a long line of movies where man meets boy and develops a mutual love.<n>Tom and Willie build a bomb shelter at the end of their garden.
19569,One of John Thaw's finest performances. He'll be remembered for his acting in this film. A fitting memorial to his art. A wonderful adaptation of a charming novel.
19570,One of the best TV movies of the 1990's which possibly would've had even greater success if it had been released in the cinemas.It is almost(but not quite)worthy of comparison with the finale to IT'S A

19574,One of the best films I've seen in a long time! A truly heart wrenching film! One of the best films I've seen in a long time!
19575,"A heartwarming film. The usual superb acting by John Thaw, who passed over recently. A man who was always so unassuming. He was one of Englands top 10 actors certainly of my time."
19576,One of John Thaw's Best! Very good! Very good! Very good! John Thaw was number 3 on TV's 50 Greatest Stars.
19577,"One of the best films I've seen in a very long time, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a fan of the book!"
19578,One of the best films I've ever seen about the Second World War - and I've seen it more than once! I'm a bit of an anorak when it comes to WW2 uniforms!
19579,John Thaw's finest performance as Inspector Morse in this classic adaptation of Tom the Tank Engine - a must see for all fans of the Inspector Morse series.
19580,"One of the best war films of all time. The human element is the star of this film. The performances are outstanding here especially by the embittered John Thaw, who is assigned a child who has been evacuated from the London bombing"
19581,This movie resonated with me on two levels. As a kid I was evacuated from London and planted on unwilling hosts in a country village. While I escaped the bombing and had experiences which produced treasured memories...
19582,"The best of Thaw's acting, and the best of Morse's acting. Buy this, you'll love it, you'll love it, you'll love it, you'll love it, you'll"
19583,A heartwarming little film. John Thaw is brilliant as always (without any hint of Inspector Morse about him). The boy playing William did a good job as well though I didn't find him convincing in every scene.

19590,A Great Movie! Why isn't it on DVD? Why isn't this one on DVD? Why isn't this one on DVD? Why isn't this one on DVD?
19591,The most realistic depiction of men under fire I've ever seen in a war film.......
19592,A wonderful and gritty war film that focuses on the inner torment of blinded marine Al Schmid. Although it is tough and unpleasant it IS in the end heroic - Schmid's triumph over disability and depression.
19593,John Garfield at his best as a Marine private in World War II.........
19594,"An excellent vintage view of Philadelphia in the 1940s. There are scenes of downtown, a train station that no longer exists, 30th Street Station--which still does exist, as well as scenes from the Northeast part of the city."
19595,A very good wartime movie showing the effects of war on a hometown boy who looses his eyesight on Guadalcanal and must come home and re-adjust himself with the help of family and friends. Eleanor Parker's role as the girlfriend was

19601,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, but it's not quite as good as I'd like it to be!"
19602,An intriguingly bold film weaves the seemingly effortless camerawork with some superb casting and an explosive soundtrack to plot the damaging effects of the crime and corruption of the Santiago underworld on 2 naive young brothers from the southern city of Temuco
19603,"A good film noir, but not one to watch over and over again........."
19604,I was pretty surprised with this flick. Even though their budjet was obviously lacking still you have to be impressed that this movie took 7 years to make and still turned out good

19618,One of the best films of the Sci-fi genre. Terry Gilliam is no stranger at pulling off such cinematic originality. 12 MONKEYS never lets up and has you guessing all the way throughout.

19656,"""War, Inc"" is not everyone's cup of tea, but it's worth a watch. I'd say it's worth a watch."
19657,This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time- and it's not just because it's a bad movie. It's one of the best films I've seen in a long time!
19658,One of the great 'Mel Brooks'-type satires of cinema.........
19659,One of the funniest films I've seen in a long time! Hilary Duff steals the show!              
19660,"the best film I've seen since Darwin's Nightmare, and I've seen it on the big screen, not on DVD. It's the real deal."
19661,One of Cusack's better films..but not as good as his other films..or as good as his first..or as good as his second..or as good as his third..or as good as his
19662,One of the funniest films I've seen in a long time..........
19663,"The spirit of the Declaration of Independence is alive and well in ""War, Inc""<n>The cast in this satire absolutely shines. Joan Cusack steals the film"
19664,"A Satire View of the ""War on Terrorism""<n>John Cusack, Marisa Tomei, Hillary Duff, Dan Ackroyd, Ben Kingsley, Joan Cusack, etc."
19665,"THIS IS NOT A ""regular"" movie...it's an anti-globalization, anti-propaganda, anti-propaganda feature."
19666,"John Cusack, Marisa Tomei, Hilary Duff, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Dan Aykroyd, Lyubomir Neikov, Ned Bellamy (Voice of Montel Williams)"
19667,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. John Cusack's acting is terrific.. and Hilary Swank's acting is stilted.
19668,One of the best short films I've seen in a long time - and I've seen it more than once. I would love to see it as a full feature film.
19669,"""Sorrow Lost"" is one of the most memorable shorts I think I have ever seen. I felt that this movie was incredibly beautiful and emotional. The story was beautifully complex - especially for such a short amount of time."
19670,One of the best films I've seen in a very long time.........
19671,One of the best short films I've seen in a long time! I'm glad I got to see it! I'm glad I didn't get to see the Witchblade guy!
19672,One of the best short films I've ever seen. Eric Etebari does a wonderful job of representing the spirit of twisted justice and helps convey the complexities of the blurred line of right and wrong.
19673,"I am blown away with your artistry with the telling of the story and your care of the special effects. You will go a long way, my friend. I will definitely be the president of your fan club."
19674,One of the first CREEPY movies I ever saw...I was about 5 at the time. It scared me GOOD! But that night I put chewing gum in one eye to be like the monster...and my mom got very upset.
19675,An absolute classic for camp. That is why it was an Elvira and MST3000 classic. Everyone knows the story.<n>The movie scared us so much as kids that my friend wouldn't go into his basement for a year after seeing
19676,The BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen--and it's still hilarious today!
19677,"A good film, but don't be fooled by its real intent. It is a sleazy story about a man obsessed with his aptitude in medical science who wishes to fuse together his dead girlfriend's head with the perfect body."
19678,One of the best low budget sci-fi movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more times than I care to remember.
19679,"When I was young I had seen very few movies. My parents in all their wisdom rented this one. I was very wary of what the movie was about, in fact I wasn't even allowed to watch it. So what did I"
19680,It's so......................
19681,A very good movie and is unfair to judge it without taking into account the time when it was released. There are some movies which do not get older but this is clearly out of date.
19682,"One of the sleaziest, trashiest horror films I've ever seen......."
19683,I can't believe I haven't seen this movie since I was 7 years old.......
19684,"One of the best horror films I've seen in a long, long time. Definitely worth a watch. Definitely a classic. Definitely a must-see."
19685,"Ghosts That Still Walk is one of those films that grabs you and doesn't let go until the end. Seeing the film as an adult, you have to admit it isn't really all that scary, but the story is very fascinating"
19686,"Boring, but worth it if you're a fan of low-budget horror films. brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr"
19687,A typical seventies mystery-drama directed by strange James T. Flocker. Nice-looking Matt Boston carries the picture with his fine performance and the typical strange atmosphere of Flocker's movies is all-present.
19688,No Strings Attached is a must-see for Carlos Mencia fans and non-believers alike...a must-see for anyone who wants to laugh and think.
19689,"One of Carlos Mencia's best performances to date. Mencia is known for poking and making fun of racial issues. However, he does more than that in this stand-up performance."
19690,"Carlos Mencia was excellent this is hour special. He was working hard to show everybody he was the real deal. I know people have said he's stolen material in this special, but that is not true."
19691,"If you're playing Sonic Adventure I DX: Director's Cut at the same time as Carlos Mencia's stand-up special, do it!"
19692,"Entertaining and heartwarming, aimed at a young audience. Again, this is ""formula"" film making, aimed at a young audience. Don't look for any surprises, but be prepared to shed a tear or two."
19693,This movie made me very happy. It's impossible not to love the smart and sweet orphan girl who changes the heart of a selfish lawyer only interested in pursuing...
19694,"Give this movie a break! Its worth at least a ""7""! That little girl is a good actor and she's cute, too. Jim Belushi is a comic genius. You can't help but feel good at the end"
19695,Curly Sue is just that. Not a complicated plot or deep meaning; however it is not devoid of substance. There are the charming little shows you can watch with your kids and have enough substance to enjoy with your date. Try it you may
19696,"One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it's funny...it's because it's made-to-order!"
19697,"It's a little cheesy, but it's worth the wait. It's a good movie, it's a good movie, it's a good movie, it's a good movie, it's a good"

19707,"The Long Day's dying is a good war film, and a good soldier's point of view.<n>It has become the forgotten film, as it is superior to many other war films I have seen."
19708,"This is not a movie you watch for entertainment, at least most people I know would not. I would place it next to ""All quiet on the western front"" and ""Die Brcke"" in terms of leaving a lasting impression."
19709,One of the best war films I've seen in a long time - if only it could be found. - Fantastic! - Well worth watching again if only it could be found. - Well worth watching again if only it could be found
19710,"Not an anti-war film, it shows war at an elite level. These are elite troops that know what they are doing and take great pride in it. Even when they are pacifist, they still enjoy the skill level and defeating their foes"
19711,"I saw this film prior to joining the British Army. I went through my basic training, at first difficult and then as I progressed much easier. My only answer was see the film 'A long day's dying'"
19712,"One of the best films I have ever seen. I wish it was available on DVD. I have seen this film only the one time about 25 years ago, and to this day I have always told people it is probably the best film I"
19713,"One of the best war films I've ever seen, a must see for anyone who has ever been in a war or knows someone in a war."
19714,The Long Day's Dying is one of the most vivid antiwar films ever made. It achieves this simply by portraying in extremely realistic terms the actions of a handful of soldiers in Northwestern Europe in 1944-45.
19715,"Italian version of Roadwarrior, with cast, that is almost famous in Italy, including Venantino Venantini. Quite entertaining movie, with some dull parts."

19722,"""Grand Slam"" is a surprisingly funny satire of the building up of celebrity. The waiter and the Russian restaurant's hat-check girl played by Loretta Young become America's sweethearts as bridge partners who do no squabble."
19723,"""To Die For"" is a really good movie.It's a little bit corny at times,but still there are enough stylish set-pieces and surprises to satisfy vampire enthusiasts."

19725,One of Deran Serafian's better films..and it's not about vampires..it's about the story..and it's about the story..and it's about the story..
19726,One of the best vampire films I've seen in a long time. A must see for fans of the genre. Not too gory but still enough to appeal to horror fans.
19727,"What went on behind the scenes when a silent film was being made? This film has all kinds of fascinating scenes of studios, movie sets, dressing rooms, editing rooms, etc."
19728,"""A Girl's Folly"" is a half-comedy, half-mockumentary look at the motion picture business of the mid-1910's"
19729,"A good little film for 1917, made by one of the top directors of the 1910s Maurice Tourneur. In it, Tourneur takes plenty of jabs at his own business, including by playing a caricature of himself--the director"

19735,"Peter O'Toole's best performance in a long, long time........."
19736,Peter O'Toole is a treat to watch in roles where the lines he speaks are good and offer a chance for him to swagger in drunken stupor. Susannah York provides a good foil for O'Toole's dramatic presence.
19737,"A good film in which Peter O'Toole and Susannah York get to overact. All in all, A good film in which Peter O'Toole and Susannah York get to overact."

19741,One of the most twisted and witty who-dunnits I ever saw. Christopher Reeve and Micheal Caine were brilliant and kept me going through the whole affair.
19742,One of the best suspense/mystery films I've seen in a long time - and one of the best I've seen in a long time.
19743,"A Who-dun-it or suspense tale that keeps you guessing throughout as to how the whole thing will end. And that's precisely what happens in DEATHTRAP, based on a chilling play by Ira Levin ""Rosemary's Baby"
19744,"HELLO, DOLLY!, HELLO, DOLLY!, HELLO, DOLLY!, HELLO, DOLLY!, HELLO, DOLLY!, HELLO, DOLLY!, HELLO, DOLLY!"
19745,One of Caine and Reeve's best together............
19746,"Excellent adaptation of Ira Levin's play, with Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve as the main characters......"
19747,No one better spoil this piece of work! Awesome movie! Written expertly by the likes of Ira Levin and depicted with the best performance of Christopher Reeve's career and one of Caine's very best
19748,"Caine, Cannon, and Reeve are superb in this fast-paced crime thriller.<n>The plot succeeds but Christopher Reeve as the younger and less established playwright decides to make a play out of the actual murder -- with only slight changes in the"
19749,One of the best Sleuth films I've seen in a long time...and it's not just because it's a murder mystery.
19750,"The trick to creating a good, solid mystery story is as much a matter of timing as its about plot contrivances, colorful characters or surprising twists."
19751,"The best stage-to-screen adaptation of ""Death Trap"" I've ever seen......."
19752,One of my favorite movies of all time. It's great and the acting is brilliant. In the scene in which Michael Caine calls the police in tears and then stops the waterworks the second he finishes the call really displays Caine's

19754,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, if not for the second rate presentation of the DVD version of ""Deathtrap"", but the tinny score and Dyan Cannon screaming at regular intervals are annoying."
19755,"Not up to ""Sleuth"" standards, but still a fun twist filled suspense ride.brbr ""Deathtrap"" is solid, well acted and fun."
19756,One of the worst films I've seen in a long time; and it's not just because it's a Michael Caine film...it's because it's a poor man's Sleuth.
19757,Excellent plot within a plot within a plot. Shame about two of my film heroes having a good snog. Must be my upbringing:)brbrVery well acted by all. You never quite know who's going to
19758,Deathtrap is not a whodunit. It's a whodunit. It's a who gonna do it to who first. It's so hard to describe this movie without giving anything away so I won't mention

19761,"It's interesting to note this much-earlier incarnation. Male bisexuality on screen may have hit its stride with ""Brokeback,"" but it's interesting to note this much-earlier incarnation."
19762,Very good dramatic comedy about a playwright trying to figure out how to keep his head above water after running out of ideas. Can't say much about this film without giving away the story.
19763,"Twists, twists, twists, twists, twists, twists, twists, twists, twists, twists, twists, twists, twists, twists, twists, twists"
19764,Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve are great in this thriller. It's very well-written...and it shows. It was originally a play...and it shows. It's mostly on one set and all talk but I was never bored
19765,This is a really good film and one that I've enjoyed watching several times. Michael Caine's awesome as always. Just watch it and adore it.
19766,"Reed Hadley as Zorro is the best of all times. He was quick, smart, used well his whip and sword, and his voice was the best for any Zorro."
19767,"""Zorro's Fighting Legion"" is one of the best action serials of the 1930s. Made in a period when the studios could still field a large cast, this one has wall to wall action throughout its 12 chapters."
19768,"Zorro, Zorro, Zorro! Zorro! Zorro! Zorro! Zorro! Zorro! Zorro! Zorro! Zorro! Zorro! Zorro! Zorro! Zorro! Zorro! Zorro! Zorro! Zorro! Zorro! Zorro! Zorro! Zorro! Zorro!"

19776,"One of the Best of the Golden Age of Serials, 1936-1945. This was one of the best of the era. The action is constant, and we are led chapter by chapter to the ultimate end where we find out the identity"
19777,"One of the best Zorro serials of all time, and probably one of the best Zorro films of all time, in a very different setting than the rest"
19778,"""Zorro's Fighting Legion"" is, as witness the comments here, one of the greatest of serials. It is exciting and generally very well made"
19779,"I love this show, but I saw the second episode first. The first episode's humor is not the best, and they struggle to properly start the series. However, I still like the light and humorous attitude of the show."
19780,An updated version of Robin Hood for the whole family to enjoy. The wardrobe has a spot of current fashion. There is a moral to each story. It is entertaining. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with a John William's feel to it

19794,"Good, but not as good as some of the other ""kids"" films I've seen, but still worth a watch. The acting was decent, and the movie didn't try to break your heart or make you cry."
19795,"One of the best films I've ever seen, and I'm not just talking about the book. I'm talking about the film itself."
19796,"I was pleasantly surprised - it was a much more realistic and modern look at fame, money, love and the price of it all. This version is so much more real than the '54 one"
19797,"One of Barbra's best, and one of the best movies of the 70's......."
19798,I like it better than the Judy Garland version and never saw Selznick's Janet Gaynor original. I do believe that they made some changes in this long-awaited DVD release.

19804,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time, and it's not just because of it's special effects...it's because it's so simple!"
19805,"A very enjoyable film. A humorous, but poignant look at family, and the obligations that come with it. The story of a man who comes home from his life to his fathers bath house in a small Chinese village."
19806,"Shower keeps within itself in so many ways. Almost all of the movie takes place in an old- time bathhouse, with the denizens supplying the humor, pathos, and emotional touches."
19807,"I LOVE this movie! Beautifully funny and utterly believable characters. Every aspect of this movie is filled with wit and humour and love and depth. A complex and engrossing story, too."
19808,"Life is what it is so we don't constantly struggle against that single compelling truth. In this film, the director shows us this truth but allows us to discover it in our own way."

19811,'Xizhao' or 'Shower' is a great movie about a father and his 2 sons. It's a $200.000 lowbudget movie about a father and his 2 sons.
19812,This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I loved it very much. I can relate to this movie from my child hood and loosing apart of my life that will never come back or ever be the same.
19813,"Very different topic treated in this film. A straightforward and simple description of local Chinese customs, by looking at the daily operation of a public bath, run by the old owner and his retarded son"
19814,"This movie is simply wonderful! It's got it all: laughter, sorrow, beauty, poetry, truth. All in a simple yet intense story--you won't get distracted for a second."

19816,"This movie is not a heavy melodrama, but it deals with harsh realities. A very very playful movie that does not dwell for a moment. Some very good acting and some wonderful smiles as well."
19817,"Very well made, with emotional subtleties, great acting, and some genuinely funny moments. It was also interesting to see a different culture - a vanishing one at that"
19818,"A film that bridged the gap between my own culture and that of the originators, i.e. chinese, in a gentle, mildly humorous manner"
19819,"This is a great story of family loyalty which, thankfully, doesn't resort to the usual tricks (or at least the ones I'm used to seeing in American and European films) of supersentimentality or high dramatic tension."
19820,One of the best movies I have ever seen. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. I loved it.

19994,"This is one of the best films ever made. I could not agree more with the quote ""this is one of the best films ever made."" If you think Vanilla Sky is simply a ""re-make,"" you could not be more wrong"
19995,One of the best films I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more than once. It's a must see for all Tom Cruise fans.
19996,"""The sweet is never as sweet without the sour"" is the theme for this movie. Tom Cruise plays a young man who takes things for granted and it comes around full swing in this great movie with a superb twist."
19997,One of the best movies i've ever seen...........
19998,"One of the best films I have ever seen. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors. This movie was not the best the first time I watched it, but after about 3 more times I decided that this is one of the best films"
19999,One of the best sci-fi movies I've seen in a long time..and one of the best I've seen in a long time.
20000,"A welcome change of pace for Cruise and Crowe. The movie isn't perfect, but its a welcome change of pace for Cruise and Crowe. For those raised on a diet of Hollywood gloss, should be a revelation."
20001,"One of those movies that's difficult to review without giving away the plot. Suffice to say there are weird things and unexpected twists going on, beyond the initial superficial ""Tom Cruise screws around with multiple women"" plot."
20002,"More ""fleshed out"" than Amenabar's original........."
20003,"I really liked this movie. I've read a few of the other comments, and although I pity those who did not understand it, I do agree with some of the criticisms."
20004,Vanilla Sky is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more times than I've seen it.

20015,Vanilla Sky is different and confusing but not weird. It was different and confusing but not weird. Different is Stanley Kubrick or Pauly Shore. Different is The Truman Show. Confusing is The Matrix or The Game. Everything makes sense...
20016,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time, and it's not just because it's Cameron Crowe's."
20017,This is the best James Bond game I have ever seen. This should be on the top of my list of all the best James Bond games of all time.
20018,One of the best bond games i have ever played because: brbrThe missions are very very very fun to play they have lots of action in them they can be really hard sometimes that makes it even more fun the weapons that
20019,"""Everything or Nothing"" is better than ""GoldenEye"" and ""From Russia With Love""<n>""EON"" is superior in terms of in-depth controls and gameplay variety. Missions range from standard running-and-gunning to driving"
20020,"One of the best Bond games of all time, and one of the best in the history of Bond video games, in a very different way..!"
20021,This is the best James Bond game I have ever seen.                  
20022,"Pierce Brosnan, Willem Dafoe, Richard Kiel, Kirsten Dunst, and John Cleese are the best James Bond's I've ever seen!"

20024,"Shelley Duvall's ""Cinderella"" is one of the best fairy tales I've seen in a long time... and it's one of her best!"
20025,"The best of Shelley Duvall's ""Faerie Tale Theatre"" series. The ugly stepsisters are broadway-quality comedy relief, and Eve Arden is the personification of wicked stepmotherhood. Jennifer Beals does an excellent job as a"
20026,"This show is awesome! and I've seen it about 6 times.brbrGranted it may be lacking in educational content as some people like those sort of movies, but I think it's great, very funny and excellently"
20027,This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time - and I'm not talking about the Jerry Springer show. I'm talking about this one.
20028,"It's not a bad movie; it's actually pretty good. If you don't like the show, don't see the movie. It starts off a little slow maybe, but then picks up and turns out to be"
20029,One of the best movies I've ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
20030,"This movie shows that real people appear on these shows and what seems like good fun and a chance to appear on television can have serious consequences.brbr Yes, i's mostly comedy, but there are some sad moments."
20031,"Very funny and very interesting. It was raw and honest and felt as if I was really watching the ""real people"" not actors. It's great entertainment, it also painted the people as human on our level not below us."
20032,"""If you think you have problems, watch a TV talk show...especially Jerry Springer's!"" This movie is one of those that is so bad, it's good! That's why I gave it a seven-it'"

20035,"Not as funny as I thought it would be, but still a good laugh........."
20036,"The Ancient Mariner is a truly classic piece of work, as the original poem was/is. The context/setting with the old mariner himself is fine, clear, and without pretense."
20037,This is a true work of art. The blend of biography with poetry and live action with animation makes this a true work of art. The length of the work makes it easily accessible for class room exposure or TV/Video time slots.
20038,The Rime of The Ancient Mariner--An Unforgettable Gem of the 1970's and 1980's.......
20039,"""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"" is a most beautiful and interesting rendition of Coleridge's haunting poem. The striking cinematography, combined with a collection of two centuries of efforts to illustrate the epic poem of 1798 by world famous artists,"
20040,An excellent presentation of Coleridge's poem and the power of the story to bring it to life in a way which awakens appreciation of it and imparts sympathy for the lesson which the ancient mariner awakens.
20041,"""A Star Is Born"" finally comes to DVD in a package that should please the most devoted fans of Barbra Streisand. That would include me since I just saw her in concert singing among other numbers, the ""Woman in the Moon"""

20048,I loved this movie when I was a teen and I still love it to this day.......
20049,A film that takes you beyond the living room into a world where the characters seem truly alive - A Star is Born is well worth the hiring price.brbrA film that draws you into the world of Esther Hoffman & the love
20050,Barbra Streisand is a tour de force in this Hollywood story. Her performances and the songs are one-of-a-kind and are special in the halls of great movies.
20051,One of the best movies I've ever seen - and I've seen it more times than I've seen this one. I've seen it more times than I've seen this one.
20052,One of the best movies i've seen in a long time! I'm still thinking about it! I'm going to watch it again!
20053,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time. brbrI highly recommend it to everyone, both for its cinematic value and its subject matter. brbrI highly recommend it to everyone."
20054,"Wow, this film had a huge impact on me, it moved me. I can not stop thinking about the fate of the little girl named Holly. The setting of the film is realistic, The film was an eye opener"
20055,"Brilliant! My wife and I joined the sprawling line to see Holly at the Edinburgh Film Festival. After seeing the film, I can understand why there was such a long line."
20056,"A good, thought-provoking film with an uncomfortable central relationship. I'd even go so far as to say it was enjoyable. I hope it gets a wide enough release to reach a decent sized audience and gain more support for the K"
20057,"""Holly"" is a powerful and moving story that should be seen by everyone. This movie should be seen by everyone. This movie should be seen by everyone because it is a beautiful story and it exposes an issue that we should no longer ignore"

20059,One of the best films I have seen in the Edinburgh Film Festival.........
20060,"Dr. Mordrid, what can I say? Jeffrey Combs has done it again!               "
20061,A very entertaining sci-fi film that's just plain fun to watch!brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
20062,"One of those rare films that is completely under the radar, but is totally worthwhile. It really reminds me of the old serials from the 30s and 40s. Which is why I'd have loved to see follow-up movies"
20063,"Jeff Combs is absolutely wonderful in it. Plays the role of the modern wizard to the hilt. (And is absolutely adorable.) 2) The movie helped to inspire a role-playing game I thoroughly enjoy, Mage: The Awakening"
20064,"Fun, but not as good as the Dr. Strange comics or the Full Moon films of the early 1990s. But it's still fun......."
20065,"""Doctor Mordrid"" is an enjoyable fantasy fare which offers plenty of cheese.The plot is pretty silly and the gore is completely absent,but the film is very short and entertaining.So if you have enough time to kill give this"
20066,One of Jeffrey Combs best performances. Good movie. I believe this is Full Moon's best movie thus far and one of Jeffrey Combs best performances.
20067,"One of the best movies ever created in the history of Jeffrey Combs. Possibly the best movie ever created in the history of Jeffrey Combs career. One that should be looked upon by all talent in Hollywood for his versatility, charisma, and"
20068,"It's not bad. Not great, but that's something else. The film involves a struggle with a mystic (evil) ""brother"" who wants to dominate the worlds, and the title character. Dr. Mordrid also has"
20069,One of the best B movies I've seen in a long time!brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
20070,Scanners II: The New Order is a great sequel to David Cronenberg's sci-fi classic Scanners. It's just as good.
20071,One of the most underrated films of all time. Why is it that the greatest films are often never heard of? I'd say bring a box of tissues.
20072,"Hard-hitting, but not as good as I thought it would be........."
20073,Mickey Rooney is one of the greatest actors of all time..........
20074,"This is a very grim, hard hitting, even brutal film about a death row break that goes awry. It's black and white photography keeps it from being dated. Mickey Rooney is excellent as the twisted, yet strangely sympathetic lead."
20075,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. A great group of actors. A little short timewise but a great movie all the same. Have only seen once since then and that was some time ago.
20076,One of Mickey Rooney's best roles!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
20077,One of the best films of all time!...........
20078,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
20079,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it many times. I've read the book, too."
20080,"An interesting TV movie based on true fact, betrayed by the description of one of the leading characters, that of a prisoner. Giovanni Ribisi plays his younger brother, who has the delicate mission of deciding if he will appeal to the courts for"
20081,"Wow, I loved this film. It may not have had the funding and advertising that the latest hollywood blockbusters get but it packs twice the emotional punch."
20082,"Entertaining Jim Belushi vehicle, a modern cockeyed version of It's A Wonderful Life. Michael Caine plays a sort of angel who lets Belush see what life would have been like if he had ""made it big."""
20083,"One of the best alternate history stories I've seen in a long, long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long, long time."
20084,"Belushi's second film, but it's not as good as ""It's a Wonderful Life"", but it's still fun."
20085,This movie is one of my favorites because it makes me think of all the choices I have made and how my life would change if my choices had been different.
20086,Belushi at his most ingratiating and Courtney Cox before Friends has a small role. I often think Belushi is under-used in Hollywood and this film role is one of his best.
20087,"""The Average Joe"" gets his 15 minutes in ""The Twilight Zone"". Michael Cane is the mysterious bar tender who not only listens to Belushi's ""story"", but has a ""cure"" for all of Belushi's"
20088,This movie is based on the concept of What If? Of course Mr. Destiny will be able to answer this question. Chaos Theory states a butterfly in China could have an effect on someone over here from a chain reaction.
20089,"Not a big box office draw, but I was pleasently surprisedbrbrwith this movie. James ""I did some things to Farrah Fawcett"" Orr brco-wrote and directed this movie about an ordinary, average guy"
20090,"One of the best movies I ve seen in a long time! I ve seen it a few times, but I ve never seen it on video!"
20091,"""Mr. Destiny's"" theme is recycled from many films spanning many different years. Its theme ranges from recent spoofs on such plots (see ""Scrooged""), to the same, more serious and dramatic notion that worked in"
20092,"If you like big films, this one is not for you. Yet it has a big - REALLY BIG plus on the story. Larry's story works, because we know this story from our own lives."
20093,"Mr. Destiny, pure escapist fun with a kicker of a message at its heart.brbr Mr. Destiny, pure escapist fun with a kicker of a message at its heart."
20094,"I actually like this movie even though I don't fancy James Belushi very much. In this movie, you can actually see several big names on the rise, Linda Hamilton and Courteney Cox..."
20095,"This movie made me realize how different things may be by changing one little thing way back in the past. Who knows, it could have changed the course of events to the point that I wouldn't have met my son's father."
20096,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time. I've seen it many times. I've enjoyed it every single time I've seen it."
20097,It's a wonderful life. But it's just come out as a cheap release on DVD and there are a lot worse ways of blowing $13. You get a film that has a surprisingly strong cast but for most they were still a

20099,One of the best movies I've ever seen..and I've seen it many times..I cried so many times..i can't count!
20100,One of the top ten made-for-tv movies of all time. ELVIS remains one of the top ten made-for-tv movies of all time.
20101,A must see for rock n roll fans. Kurt Russell's performance is the best of his career...and it's not just because he's the King...it's because he's Kurt Russell.
20102,"Kurt Russell IS Elvis. His dedication to this role resulted in what I think, is the best movie bio ever. If you're an Elvis fan, see it if you can."
20103,"One of the best T.V. movies I've seen in a long, long time! And Kurt Russel could've been Elvis' twin!"
20104,One of the best movies ever made. Why isn't it out on DVD or Video? I'd love to see it on the TV again!
20105,"One of the best Elvis movies I've ever seen. I'm still amazed at how accurate Kurt Russell portrays Elvis, right down to how he moves and the expressions on his face."
20106,So many things were false in this film. I know all movies based on past have something false but these things are so obvious to people who like Elvis.
20107,"A pretty memorable movie of the animals-killing-people variety, specifically similar to ""Willard"" in that it stars an aging character actor (in this case, a step down a bit to the level of Les Tremayne)"
20108,"""Lost"" is one of the best shows I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it's the best. It's because it's the best."

20115,"A show that sings to it's own tune, whether it's audience chooses to follow or not. How many other shows so boldly change in tone from one season to the next?"
20116,One of the greatest shows ever to be on television. This show is without a doubt one of the greatest shows ever to be on television. I mean this is without a doubt one of the greatest shows ever to be on television.
20117,"I am obsessed! The story is amazing and the show is highly addictive, but I love it. I am on Season 2, disc 5, and I tell you that I am too attached to the characters now."

20123,One of the best series I've seen in a long time - and I've seen it more times than I've watched it! I can't believe it's been so long since I've watched it!
20124,One of the best shows I've seen in a long time but not as good as I'd like it to be.....
20125,The first series of Lost kicked off with a bang... literally and slowly decreased in pace. This may have put some viewers off and people who started to watch halfway through would either be bored or just plain confused.
20126,Lost is an extremely well made TV series about some people that are lost on an island. there's so many twists and turns that you can't really decide who your favourite character is.
20127,One of the best TV series of all time............
20128,"Lost is largely considered one of the most beautiful TV series that have never done... and so is... if you lovers of mysteries, intrigue and adventure this is the series for you..."

20137,One of the best family movies we've seen in a long time - please ignore the negative reviews and give this one a chance - we were really glad we did!
20138,"It's a movie about some Chinese eye-candy idols and musicians who can play basketball at an unreal level of expertise. A love interest. It's formulaic but really, suspend disbelief for a while. It's called Kung Fu"
20139,"Just watch, smile, laugh, and brbr br br br br br br br br br br br "
20140,"A mess of genres but it's mainly based on Stephen Chow's genre mash-ups for it's inspiration. There's magic kung-fu, college romance, sports, gangster action and some weepy melodrama for a topping"

20211,"Do you know what the 2 sports cars were? I think Robert Stack's might have been a Masseratti.Rock Hudson's character told his father he was taking a job in Iraq,isn't that timely?"
20212,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, but it's not as good as I'd have liked it to be."

20218,"Lauren Bacall, Rock Hudson, Dorothy Malone, & Robert Stack all star in this great film.<n>The story is a little soapy from another time but just as worthwhile as most....."
20219,"Douglas Sirk at his most high strung. This gloriously turgid melodrama represents Douglas Sirk at his most high strung. It eschews the soft wistfulness of ""All That Heaven Allows"" and weepy sentimentality of ""Imitation of Life"
20220,"One-dimensional, 100-percent soaper. You might call it the ultimate soaper. I wouldn't even call it a melodrama (such as ""Mildred Pierce"" or ""Imitation of Life"")"
20221,"One of Malone's best roles, but not up to Sirk's standards.<n>A Technicolor film noir in the vein of LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN"

20227,"The grandaddy of all dysfunctional family films. Douglas Sirk scores again with this, the grandaddy of all dysfunctional family films. This lush, trashy saga is a masterpiece, beautifully combining all of the elements of Sirk's soap"
20228,"""Written on the Wind"" is a sexy soap opera, but it's also a social commentary on 1950's life. Douglas Sirk scores again with another Univeral sudser."
20229,"An overblown melodrama typical of its period (mid-1950s) and appropriate matinée food. Rock Hudson, the hulk everyone always falls in love with, plays his usual stereotype role..."
20230,"One of Douglas Sirk's best, but it's all about the river........"
20231,"I'm not sure if this is some kind of masterpiece or just sleazy fluff elevated by the performances and visuals. Whatever the case, I'm sure I loved it."
20232,"""Written on the Wind"" is an irresistible, wonderfully kinky film, as only director Sirk could have done it. The movie is submerged in a bucket full of Freudian symbols, weird melodramatics and colorful contrasts."

20253,Jason Patric is the man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

20255,"A great film noir adaptation of Jim Thompson's novel. Jason Patric is great as ""Kid"" Collins in this wonderful adaptation of the Jim Thompson novel. Far superior to ""The Grifters"", which was a good movie."
20256,"""After dark, my sweet"" is a strange mix of sensuality and dullness. The film runs slow, very slow, but takes a rythm to tell a story about murder and passion. Jason Patric never ever was so sexy and"
20257,"It should have been set in the 50's and not the '90's. See, 40 year old mores and values tend not to play as well, or ring as true, that far down the road."

20292,Good Times was a groundbreaking comedy about the first nuclear black family living in the Chicago projects. This show is still a treasure to watch and observe a family being just a family rather than a show about a poor black family.
20293,"I would like to know why John Amos left the show. I couldn't relate to everything, but sometimes they hit home with the problems they were facing. By the way, did they ever make it out of the ghetto?"
20294,"""Good Times"" is a must-see CBS hit! It's hard to say which one is my favorite! It's hard to say which one is my favorite!"
20295,One of the Best Sit-coms I've Seen in a long time..but it fell off a cliff after John Amos' departure..and Esther Rolle's return.

20324,"One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long, long time........"
20325,I loved this movie. In fact I loved being an actress in this movie. You may remember me more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf was exposing himself on film.

20340,one of the best movies i have seen in a long time..........
20341,One of the best films I've seen in a long time.........
20342,"Wow, whoa now. You cannot be serious. I was pleasantly surprised when I first watched the movie when it came out in 1994 and even liked it more today watching it more today watching it..."
20343,"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues is the best movie I've seen in a long, long time, and it's grown on me. I can't think of any movie that has ""grown on me"" after an ina"
20344,"This was an excellent film. I don't understand why so many people don't like it. There was so much in it to connect with, so many beautiful images, and so much compassion in the things that weren't said"
20345,"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues is a bad film, but it's not bad at all. It's not bad, it's just bad."
20346,A delightful little romantic-comedy that deserves to be seen by more people!brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
20347,"Bette Davis at her best in this film. Please put it on DVD. I would buy it immediately. I have not seen it in more than thirty years, on television, but remember it well."
20348,"""The Whales of August"",'87 was one of Bette Davis' best roles in a long career in Hollywood. Daisey Appleby was very young and attractive and performed one of her best roles in a long career in Hollywood."
20349,"This is a great show, and will make you cry, this group people really loved each other in real life and it shows time and time again. Email me and let's chat. I have been to Australia and they real do talk"
20350,"One of the best of the ""Nightmare"" series. Maybe not, but I had lots of fun with it. Freddy reaches his evil, wisecracking potential."
20351,"FREDDY has gone from scary to funny,in this 6th installment in the Nightmare series.brbr Rachel Talalay,who has been contected to the nightmare series for a long time by now.Many people hate this"
20352,"This is the last of the ""Elm Street"" films until Wes Craven resurrected Freddy into a different, darker style in ""New Nightmare"" and the silly but surprisingly enjoyable spin-off horror film ""Freddy Vs Jason"""
20353,Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare is the final installment in the Freddy Krueger series. It's a great way to end the series. A whole lot better than the last one.
20354,"The Movie Freddy's dead the final nightmare is just as horrific and disturbing as every other Nightmare on elm street, yes it has Comedy essence about it, so has all the other films"
20355,one of the best of the series.a must see for all fans of the series.a.k.a. fans of the 80s and 90s.
20356,Not as good as the other Nightmares but still a good movie. brbrI recommend it if you enjoy the series. brbrNext on my list Wes Cravens New Nightmare. br
20357,"It's not the worst, it's not the worst, it's not the worst, it's the best, it's the best, it's the best, it's the best, it's"
20358,"The Final Nightmare is one of the best horror movies of all time, and it's not just about the boogeyman. It's about Freddy!"
20359,This is the best of the best. The best of the best. The best of the best. The best of the best. The best of the best.
20360,Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare is the best of all the elm street movies! I think it's the best of all the Freddy's!
20361,"""Ship Ahoy"" was probably made in order to showcase MGM talent. The film is a fun trip on an ocean liner on its way to San Juan, Puerto Rico, at the time in which the country was involved in WWII."
20362,Miss Powell's best performance in a long time! She's the best dancer in the cast! She's the best! She's the best!
20363,"Eleanor Powell is the star of this MGM musical, and Red Skelton is the best dancer in the cast.<n>The plot of this enjoyable MGM musical is contrived and only occasionally amusing, dealing with espionage and romance but the focus of the film"
20364,"Powell's dancing is superb and worth the price of admission. And in this one Lahr plays his cowardly lion, evoking warm memories of that Technicolor film of 1939."
20365,One of the best movies I've ever seen...........
20366,What you see is what you get. Not really! What Madhur Bhandarkar's brave and brilliant 'Page 3' does is destroy the myth attached to the glam and glitterati that colour the pages of our newspapers and whose lives we
20367,"Page 3 is a good movie, not to be watched with children or expecting wives. Serious movie, not to be watched with children or expecting wives. Madhur Bhandarkar starts a new journey from here."
20368,"Page 3 is one of Bhandarkar's better films, but it's one-sided and overly pessimistic. This film is all about tabloid journalism, gossip, celebrities."
20369,"I wish I could give it 5 stars, but I can't........."
20370,Page 3 is an eye-opener that exposes the hypocrisy of the rich and the famous in the city of Mumbai.....
20371,What is madhur bhandarkar finally wants to say? What is madhur bhandarkar finally wants to say? What is madhur bhandarkar finally wants to say?
20372,One of the best movies I've seen in a very long time!brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
20373,The movie is a real show of how unemotional and selfish the upper society has become. It has plenty of characters and each and every character is representing a different category of person.
20374,Page 3 is a revelation of the naked truth irrespective of the crudeness attached to it. The movie has a message and it is crude. The audience needs to get it in their own color.
20375,"A wild ride to the wild side of Mumbai's hi-society.<n>Bhandarkar does a swell job of digging up the dirt on the drama kings, the dancing queens and the living dead."
20376,"PAGE 3 is a brilliant film by Madhur from CHANDNI BAR. Konkana excels as Madhavi, Upendra Limaye excels in his part as the cop and Sandhya Mridul is good too."
20377,Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant!
20378,"Page 3 is a great movie. The story is so refreshing and interesting. Not once throughout the movie did i find myself staring off into space. Konkana Sen did a good job in the movie, although i think someone with more glamour or"
20379,"Another tell-it-as-it-is Madhur Bhandarkar film, but it's not as good as Mr & Mrs Iyer's"
20380,An eye opener for those who can only have the glamorous lifestyles of the stars. It tells you how people who would like to do good are not able to.
20381,One of Mary Pickford's best roles...and one of her best as a young woman...and one of her best as a young woman...and one of her best as an adult.
20382,Mary Pickford at her best in TESS OF THE STORM.........
20383,"One of the most beautiful women I've ever seen in a silent movie. Imagine a movie fan in 1922, having never seen anyone that gorgeous and that expressive before. You would have to see her again and again."
20384,"TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY--a little dated, but still good. Mary Pickford's best film....."
20385,"One of Mary Pickford's finest performances in a 1922 silent film. At two hours, it was quite long for a 1922 silent film yet continues to hold your interest some 80 years after it was filmed. Mary gives one of her finest"
20386,"A wonderful film about being honest and true to family friends and to be willing to make sacrifices. Mary Pickford, honest, feisty, full of happiness and joy, faithful, humorous and..."
20387,"Mary Pickford's ""Tess"" is the best movie role of her career!<n>""Tess"" also provides an insight into the work of another fine actress, Gloria Hope, whose work was entirely confined to silent cinema"
20388,Tess of the Storm Country is a Mary Pickford vehicle I had intended to get for some time. I finally found a VHS copy for a reasonable price and got to enjoy it.
20389,This film has special effects which for it's time are very impressive. Some if it is easily explainable with the scenes played backwards but the overlay of moving images on an object on film is surprisingly well done given that this film was made
20390,THE CAMERAMAN'S REVENGE is a very early example of 'pixilation' by the hard-working pioneer Wladyslaw Starewicz
20391,"An excellent example of Ladislas Starewicz's early puppetry, but the film moves slowly. Despite its pace, the film is an excellent example of Starewicz's early puppetry and is highly recommended."
20392,Ladislaw Starewicz's Cameraman's Revenge is a must-see for children of all ages! The Cameraman's Revenge is a must-see!
20393,"""The Cameraman's Revenge"", or ""The Revenge of a Kinematograph Cameraman"" is a delight of early animation, brimming with highly-effective stop-motion puppetry and no shortage of imagination."
20394,"One of the best short films I've seen in a long time, but it's not for the faint of heart. It's not for the faint of heart."
20395,"One of the best animated movies I've ever seen in my life. This isn't just a fun movie, or a well-made movie. This is a landmark in the art of animation and even if it weren't,"
20396,"A little film that's just as good as a full-length, but not as good as a full-length, full-length, full-length film!"
20397,One of the best shows I've seen in a long time...but it's not Emmy-worthy...it's just TV...it's just TV!
20398,"This was a great show, but you left us hanging. If you're going to introduce new drama/mysteries, at least air a conclusion before abruptly ending mid-theme."
20399,One of the best shows I have seen in a long time. Please bring it back to the Fox network. It's the best show I have seen in a long time.
20400,Bring back this show!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
20401,"i'm not very happy with fox right now. even more so after discovering that NO ENDING WAS FILMED. i mean, if you're going to work on a project, at least finish it to see what happens."
20402,"a must see for all Bolan fans, even if you're not a fan of the band, or just a fan of Marc Bolan himself!"
20403,"BORN TO BOOGIE is a real 'find'--though a rock fan for nearly thirty years, I only first saw the film a few days ago, and rank it among the top rock films of all time"
20404,Marc Bolan & T.Rex at their very best!!brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
20405,"Fun to watch, but missing some of the songs I would have liked to have seen on there, but like any album it can't have everything."
20406,One of the best Beatles films I've ever seen...........
20407,"""Kriemhild's Revenge"" is a magnificent tale of fantasy, adventure, romance and betrayal; the second part is a dramatic story of hate, revenge and loyalty. Margarete Schn is impressive with a total different"
20408,A wonderful silent film about the tragic Nibelungen saga. brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
20409,"The second part of UFA studio's gargantuan production of the Nibelungen saga continues in the stylised, symphonic and emotionally detached manner of its predecessor."
20410,"The Wrath of Kriemhild is better than Siegfried's Death, but it's not quite as good as Siegfried's, though it's better."
20411,I finally got my wish to see this one in a cinema. I'd seen Fritz Lang's film on video some years ago. I'd been hoping that ideal screening conditions would work their magic.
20412,"Die Nibelungen: Kriemhilds Rache (1924).Kriemhild (Margarete Schoen) wants to avenge her murdered husband, Siegfried.Her brother is too weak to bring the murdered, Hagen, to justice"
20413,"""Die Nibelungenlied"" is one of Fritz Lang's best movies...but it's not quite Siegfried's ""Siegfried"""
20414,"Great battle finale and nice sets help keep this often-slow movie enjoyable. At times it had me checking my watch, although there were enough memorable moments to make the film stand out in my mind days after watching it."
20415,A must-see film for students in speech and media law. Why speaking out against injustice is important and can bring about the changes sought by the oppressed. Why freedom of the press and freedom of speech are essential to democracy.
20416,One of the best films I've seen in a long time - and it's not just because it's a black film. It's because it's a black film.
20417,"Not the story of Steve Biko, but the story of Donald Woods, played by Kevin Kline..<n>Not the story of Steve Biko, but the story of Donald Woods, played by Denzel Washington."
20418,"An excellent primer for those wanting an overview of apartheid's cruelty in just a couple of hours. As villified as the whites (particularly the Afrikaners) are portrayed in the film, any observant (non-casual) visitor to"
20419,"""Cry Freedom"" stands out as possibly the best ever work for all involved in the anti-apartheid movement. One of two movies (along with ""A World Apart"") that helped galvanize the anti-apartheid movement."
20420,"An overlong, but compelling retelling of the friendship between civil rights leader Steve Biko and Donald Woods. The first half of the film is the strongest where we see the bond formed between the two men, and how they help each other out"
20421,It's sad to view this film now that we know how the ANC got shafted by international capitalism. Biko died for nothing much. Woods achieved little.
20422,The Direction is outstanding from David Attenborough as it was for Gandhi although if there is any critisism to be aimed it could be at the length of the film
20423,"""The True Story Of The Friendship That Shook South Africa And Awakened The World.""               "
20424,One of the most powerful movies I've seen in a long time. I've never seen a movie like this before. I've never seen anything like it.
20425,The impact this film had on me as a young boy. I still remember the feelings it invoked in me and i remembered crying a lot as were most of my friends. I think at the age we were we found it shocking and quiet outraged
20426,"Powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful,"
20427,'Cry Freedom' is a gripping tale of a man's escape from South Africa.......
20428,'Cry Freedom' is a movie about how far people will go to find the truth. I found the second half about Don woods struggle to have Biko's story be heard around the world much more interesting.
20429,"This is the best film I have ever seen. It shows South African racism from the perspective of the victims, and provokes a feeling of anti-racism in everyone who sees it."
20430,One of the best historical films I've ever seen. It's a must-see for every historical film fan. It's a masterpiece.
20431,"A long film about a very important character from South Africa, Stephen Biko. He is one of these Blacks who did not survive apartheid, who actually died a long time before their normal time."
20432,"Cry Freedom is not about Biko or Apartheid as much as it is about Donald Woods, the white liberal newspaper editor who risked his life trying to tell Biko's story."
20433,"What is ""Cry Freedom"" like? It is simply great and unique experience about making of South Africa and how black people in that country were repressed by white people."
20434,"One of the best films I have ever seen, and the best film I've ever seen......."
20435,This is a film that everyone should watch. Quite apart from raising hugely important points (while South Africa is on the road to recovery there are still many countries in similar situations now)
20436,"One of the greatest films of all time, and one of John Ford's best.. and one of his best.. and one of his best.."
20437,'The Informer (1935)' was John Ford's first major Oscar success. Victor McLaglen gives a powerful performance that betrays a lifetime of unsatisfying existence.
20438,"""Gypo"" is a psychological drama, with thought, philosophy, sadness, all conveyed with as little words as possible. This is a psychological drama, with thought, philosophy, sadness, all conveyed with as little words as possible."
20439,"Gypo Noland, Victor Mclaglen & Co., The Power of Crime & Punishment in the 21st Century.<n>Gypo Noland, Victor Mclaglen & Co., The Power of Crime & Punishment"
20440,"One of the best film noirs of the 40's and early 50's. Very nice attention to detail also;during Frankie McPhillip's (Wallace Ford's) wake, the mourners are all praying in Gaelic."
20441,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, but it's not as good as I'd like it to be...."
20442,"The Informer shows the extent to which wordless moments can convey story.<n>McLaren's performance does not look like much, being as it is about 90% drunk act. But the other 10% is heartfelt emoting"
20443,"""Call Out the Marines"",'42, was a great film for 1935 and Victor McLaglen gave an outstanding performance as an Irish rebel who belonged to a rough and tough crowd who were all fighting for a cause and at the same time"
20444,"The fog is ubiquitous, half disguising the shabbiness of the production. If there's a bar, the name painted on the front window says simply, ""Wine And Spirits."""
20445,"""Enter the Fat Dragon"" is one of the funniest martial art movies I had the opportunity to see. Sammo Hung portrays a Chinese farm boy that comes to visit a city friend. Just like Tang Lung of ""Way of the Dragon."""
20446,"One of Sammo's great early comedy films. Nominal story about how his fighting keeps causing his loved ones trouble - then fighting. Well, I guess I've seen enough white fake-as-hell ""Chinese people"" in"
20447,"This is not a kung fu movie. This is a comedy about kung fu. And if, before making this film, Sammo Hung hadn't spent some time watching films by the great French comic filmmaker Jaques Tati..."
20448,"One of Hung's better early efforts. The humor is dead-on in parts as Hung tries to imitate Lee's moves and facial expressions, and also in a bit where Hung pokes fun at Jackie Chan's Drunken Master"
20449,The most agile fat guy in martial arts does it again. A great beer and buddies movie that is worth an hour and a half of anyone's time.
20450,"I liked the movie, but I was disappointed that they used an Asian to play a black man in the movie. I mean really. Talk about bad taste. During a fight scene, you see one of the fighters on the floor is laughing"
20451,"Meloni and Janel hook up for a nice little sleeper/character study. Plot's nothing fancy, but the acting is right on the mark. Tim Busfield shows up for some neat bits. Worth a look."
20452,"Meloni Maloney, Janel Maloney, Timothy Busfield, and Janel's acting make this a good film...but not Busfield's."
20453,Christopher Meloni and Janel Moloney are the stars of this movie. Hilarious........
20454,Christopher Meloni's Souler Opposite is a must-see for all Meloni fans!<n>Tim Busfield's character is the real star of the film!
20455,The Souler Opposite is the funniest movie I have ever seen. It goes deeper than that. It gives me hope that there is love out there. I hope we will be seeing more films from everyone involved in the future.
20456,"This is a psychological drama about the rookie and his mentor that just happens to be about killing people. In this way it works extremely well, with terrific performances from Berenger and Zane (who doesn't sleepwalk through the movie like he"
20457,"""Sniper"" is still well worth watching for the story about a person who until now has not really been glamorized in war movies: A solitary killer who kills with the precision and skill of a master diamond cutter or accomplished neurosurgeon"
20458,"""Sniper"" has some good moments, but with a bit of trimming, it could have been a bit more satisfying.<n>""Sniper"" offers 112 minutes of action that with a bit of trimming would have made a"
20459,"Don't listen to the critics, as it is not as bad as most say it is!! And yes, the movie has many flaws, but what movie doesn't?"
20460,"One of the best war movies I've seen in a long time, and it's a low-budget one at that....."
20461,Solid thriller with solid performances from Zane and Berenger...........
20462,"""One shot, one kill, no exceptions. One shot, one kill, no exceptions. One shot, one kill, no exceptions. One shot, one kill, no exceptions."""
20463,Not a good action movie but a good psychological one.<n>Two different snipers who had different personalities and different experiences....
20464,"One of the best action movies I've seen in a long time, and Tom Berenger makes it worth it....."
20465,"One of the best war movies I've seen in a long time. brbr I loved the scene where hundred soldiers get shooting at the jungle, no-one quite sure where that shot came. brbr"
20466,"Zane and Beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats. I don't typically go for military/war movies, but this was worth my time."
20467,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and it's just as good for a girl as it is for a man."
20468,"One of the best military dramas I've seen in a long, long time! Tom Berenger as Beckett is the real deal! This is a great movie!"
20469,another great Tom Berenger movie.. Billy Zane was a wuss at first just like Cpl Upham from Saving Private Ryan but then he got a little...
20470,"I am curious of what rifle Beckett was using in the movie, and also the caliber of the bullet that he was suppose to be firing. If this is loosely based on Carlos Hathcock's sniping, I am guessing that it"
20471,"This is the best movie Ive ever seen!!! Thomas Beckett & Richard Miller -two mankinds who want to survive in the ""jungle"" of violence and madnes, one shot - one killed!!?"
20472,One of the best action movies I have seen in a long time!I recommend it to all of you!I am sure you will have a good time watching it!
20473,"It's not just for kids, it's for adults too, too, with a lot of heart and humor too! brbr br br br br br "
20474,"the best muppet film i've seen in a long time, and i've seen it more than once. i've seen it more than once."
20475,One of my all-time favorite films...and it's not just because it's a Muppets movie...it's because it's so funny!
20476,"The Muppets still have their charm and comical antics, which obviously also helps carry the movie for the most part. There are some weaker moments, such as the Muppet babies sequence, and Juliana Donald's performance as Jenny is lacklustre."
20477,"The Muppets are back with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their friends. Okay, they are trying to get on Broadway in a musical show in where else but New York City. You will see cameos by the then New York City Mayor"
20478,"The third Muppet movie is perhaps the most relaxed and pleasing, with the gang taking their modest college musical to the bright (yet volatile) lights of Broadway filled with typically nave optimism."
20479,The funniest Muppets movie I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once
20480,"""The Muppets Take Manhattan"" is different in a lot of ways to every other Muppet Movie made so far. For one, it remains the only Muppet film not owned by Disney."
20481,"One of the best Muppet movies I've ever seen, but not as good as The Muppet Show's last season or The Great Muppet Caper!"
20482,"Another great Muppet flick. This time, Kermit, Fozzie, Miss Piggy, Scooter, Rowlf, The Electric Mayhem, Gonzo and Camilla the chicken are out of college and starring in a musical that they're trying to get on"
20483,"A strange mix of a movie and a family film - the whole family can enjoy it. Its a strange mix of a movie, as its seems to have a movie within it, but at least it does make sense at the end (unlike"
20484,The Muppets are so cool and they approach show business in a refreshingly naive way. My favorite scene is when the rats start a whispering campaign on behalf of Kermit at a fancy restaurant.
20485,"If you like the muppets I defy you to dislike this one. Basically the same plot regurgitated (this time New York, not LA) it features a lot of fun cameos and muppet hi-jinx"
20486,"It's another great Muppet's movie and I adore them all; the characters, the movies, the TV show episodes (it's the best comedy or musical TV show ever) and all the artists behind it. But here they"
20487,"Not the best, but still fun to watch : : :........."
20488,The best Muppet movie I've ever seen! The best Muppet movie I've ever seen! The best Muppet movie I've ever seen! The best Muppet movie I've ever seen!
20489,"MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN is nothing special, but miles more enjoyable than MERRY MUPPET Christmas. I must state though that MUPPET MOVIE, GREAT MUPPET CAPER and MUPPET Christmas CAROL are"
20490,"One of the best youth series of all time, but not as good as the first three. Please release a good quality DVD of the series, that would be wonderful."
20491,"Freewheelers is a show that's very much ""of its time"". But is that a bad thing? I for one don't think so."
20492,"This game is very addictive, I kept playing it for hours straight until late at night but also the fact that you can't save a game when you are in space..."
20493,This is a great game! Okay perhaps it didn't have some of the features it was meant to have but Digital Anvil have still come up with a good game.
20494,One of the best sci-fi games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. It's a must-have for any sci-fi fan.
20495,"Maslin Beach is a real nudist/naturist beach south of Adelaide, on the Fleurieu Peninsula, in South Australia. It is also the name of an Australian film that used the beach as a location."
20496,A great excuse to sit back and enjoy Maslin's nudists and their own personal stories. A great movie to watch with the wife or girlfriend.
20497,Maslin Beach on free to air TV in Australia - a must for all Australian's - even if you don't know what it is about.
20498,One of the finest movies I have seen for quite some time. Exquisite direction and flawless acting make this a very entertaining and often moving film. Highly recommended!
20499,Don't read the plot...don't read the plot...don't read the plot...don't read the plot...don't read the plot...don't read the plot...don't read the plot
20500,"One of the best, if not the best film i have seen for a very, very long time. This has to be one of the best, if not the best film i have seen for a very, very long time."
20501,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time...and I'm a Mexican...I'm glad I did...I loved it!
20502,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.........
20503,"A powerful example of cinema at its most sinister, exploitative, and effective. Scott has a tough thing to sell, but I think I'm a buyer."
20504,"A gritty, get-the-bad guys revenge story starring Denzel Washington. He's three personalities here: a down-and-out-low-key-now drunk- former mercenary, then a loving father-type person to a"
20505,"one of the best action movies i've seen in a long time - and one of the best i've seen in a long, long time."
20506,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
20507,"One of the best action films of the last ten years, but flawed at times.<n>Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, and Tony Scott give good performances"
20508,"""Man on Fire"" is a coolly efficient action picture that never shies away from the raw brutality of its subject matter. It takes a risk in asking us to identify with a man who is, for all intents and purposes,"
20509,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time but the visuals make it look like it's been possessed by demons and the soundtrack makes you feel like you're being punished.

20523,"Revenge is the theme of this Denzel Washington thriller that offers its share of action, mayhem, murder and grisly bloodletting. The Mexico City locations are as chaotic as the storyline moves towards its predictable, violent conclusion."

20558,"One of the better giallos I've seen in a long time, but it's a little short on the murder-set-pieces."

20565,One of the scariest and most intriguing episodes of Doctor Who. This is a thrilling psychological ride and you will probably find your own beliefs being thrown into question.
20566,"This was an excellent 2-part episode, although I had never been seen the older ones, I never thought the doctor would go up against anything that is paranormal"
20567,"A solid episode of the 2nd parter of the 2nd series of the Doctor Who series, The Impossible Planet (Part 2 of The Impossible Planet)"

20582,Even a competent dentist is pretty scary. It's one of man's primal fears. This movie is the nightmarish image every kid has to go through in the waiting room. Corbin Bernsen gives a surprisingly non-lackluster performance as
20583,"One of the best horror films I've seen in a long, long time........"
20584,"The Dentist is actually a really good film. The acting isn't always top notch, but the thrills are good and the story's good. Plus you see Linda Hoffman's boobies."
20585,"One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long, long time...and it's not just because it's about a dentist...it's about a dentist!"
20586,"Corbin Bernson, Linda Hoffman, and Virginya Keehne are the stars of this movie...and it's pretty convincing too!...but it's a gory mess!"
20587,The Dentist is one of the best horror films I've seen in a long time... & it's not just because it was directed by Brian Yuzna!

20594,"The Dentist is very cool, but not for everyone. The Dentist has lots of gory scenes. That's why it has it's R18 rating. It's best to go to your dentist ""before"" you watch this"
20595,"One of Brian Yuzna's better films... but not as good as Return of the Living Dead 3, but still worth a watch. The Dentist is one of his best!"
20596,This Movie is a Pure Pleasure. It has the Ever so Violent Horror Mixed with a Little Suspense and A Lot of Black Comedy. The Dentist Really Starts to loose His Mind and It's Enjoyable to Watch him do so.
20597,"""Fear Of A Black Hat"" is better than ""Fear Of A Black Hat""--and it's better than ""Fear Of A Black Hat""--and it's better than ""Fear Of A Black Hat"""

20601,"Is ""My Peanuts"" better than ""Big Bottom"" (from Spinal Tap)? I don't know - but they're both damn funny"
20602,"This is a really funny film, especially the second, third and fourth time you watch it. It's a pretty short film, and i definitely recommend watching it more than once, you will 'get it' more the second time."

20607,"One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. I'm white and like classic rock, but i'm not a rap fan."
20608,"Hilarious spoof of Hip-Hop culture. It is just as funny as This Is Spinal Tap, if not funnier. The actors are incredible and the documentary style is superb. Mark Christopher Lawrence is a tremendous talent that should be starring in"

20620,"One of the most hilarious films of all time. If you know _anything_ about rap music - YOU MUST SEE THIS!! If you liked Bob Roberts, you'll love this!"
20621,Just as good as the original. Very nearly achieves greatness because of Cundieff's remarkable ear for music and dialogue. Skewers the self-important swagger of the hip-hop poseurs.
20622,"I'm a big fan of Spinal Tap, so naturally I had to check this out. It was deriviative from This Is Spinal Tap, sometimes blatantly, but this film still stood on it's own as an original,"

20627,I first saw this as a child living in East London. The scars of Hitlers Luftwaffe were all too evident and the landscape of the movie was reminiscent of our street. I remember having nightmares after seeing it.
20628,A film that presages the SF blockbusters that would take another 40 years to arrive on the silver screen. This is a stunning film not to be missed by anyone at all interested in the SF genre.
20629,"One of the few serious British science-fiction films to date in 1936, but it's over-earnest and over-simplistic.."
20630,One of the rare films about the future--but the VHS versions are horrible. I hope a good DVD exists of the entire film. Most versions have edited out a rather interesting montage of futuristic workers and machines that takes us from 1970 to
20631,One of the best sci-fi movies of all time!

20644,"Things to Come is a classic work of speculative fiction. It makes some surprising accurate depictions of the war that was to follow a few years later, but is woefully naive in it's Utopian ideals."
20645,Amazing effects for a movie of this time. A primer of the uselessness of war and how war becomes a nurturer of itself.brbrA wonderful thing about this movie is it is now public domain and available at archive.

20650,"The future as seen from 1939 England. As war loomed over Europe, the salvation of mankind will not be found in the politics of the past. It is up to the brave new world of science to overcome man's past mistakes."

20657,"One of the best animated films of all time, but it's not quite as good as The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring."
20658,"Bakshi's version of the Lord of the Rings isn't quite as good as Jackson's, but it's still worth a look."
20659,This is a very beautiful film. The backgrounds are gorgeous and taken from well known Tolkein artists. The film covers about half the trilogy (Fellowship of the Ring and up to the battle of Helms Deep in the Two Towers)
20660,Bakshi's version of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings is better than Jackson's version of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
20661,"One of the best adaptations of Tolkien's book ever made...and it's not just because it's a ""computer-rendered"" film."
20662,"Not as bad as I thought it would be, but not as good as I've seen a lot of other adaptations of Tolkien's books. Not the greatest adaptation of a book, but trust me, I've seen a lot"

20668,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time........."
20669,"Not as bad as many say it is, but NOWHERE near as good as the 2001 live action version of The Lord of the Rings! I'll take the animated version over the live version anyday!"
20670,"it could of been a bit better, it could of had alot more talking and story to it than just 15 to 20 minute scenes that just had wierd fighting. then for the last 5 or 10 minutes the movie picked up and got good again"

20674,"Brilliant movie. Too bad it ended before it begun. Too bad it ended before it begun. I ve waited 21 years for a sequel, but nooooo!!!"
20675,The best part of this movie was Shernaz Patel. She is a true veteran thespian who is overqualified for every role she is offered. But I must say I appreciated her contribution greatly as she played Virendra's wife.
20676,"Not many reviews, hence thought i would add one. This was a excellent movie. RKS is one of the very few Indian directors that can actually put together a really good movie."
20677,One of the best action movies of all time. Even though this was a disaster in the box office. It is my favorite film. It gives a powerful message of family. It has a lot of violence and has one song with a bunch
20678,A movie made for contemporary audience. The masses get to see what they want to see. This is not exactly a movie that one would feel comfortable watching with entire family. I had to fast forward quite a number of scenes.

20681,"One of John Ford's best films, and one of my all-time favorites. Victor McLaglen's best performance in a Ford film. One of my all-time favorites."
20682,A brilliant portrait of a traitor (Victor McLaglen in Oscar winning performance) who is hounded by his own conscience. McLaglen plays an IRA rouge who betrays his leader to collect a reward during Ireland's Sinn Fein Rebellion.
20683,"Magnificent and unforgettable, stunningly atmospheric, and brilliantly acted by all. I really cannot understand what sort of people are panning this masterpiece and giving the preponderance of votes as 8 (and nine ones!)"
20684,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, if not for a remake. A very good film. A very good film. A very good film. A very good film. A very good film well worth watching."
20685,The Informer is a fine film. John Ford wouldn't have gotten his first Best Director Oscar if it wasn't. No split involved in his award.
20686,"One of John Ford's best, if not his best, films........."
20687,"It's old, it's a classic, ""be kind"", ""it's a classic"", ""it's a classic"", ""be kind"""
20688,One of Victor McLaglen's best roles. He won the Oscar for Best Actor in this movie.. What's wrong with that?!?
20689,One of John Ford's best films. Victor McLaglen delivers an Oscar-winning portrayal of disgraced IRA soldier Gypo Nolan on the worst night of his life.
20690,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time -- and one of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time."
20691,One of John Ford's best films - if not his very best. The Informer won four Oscars including one for him for best director in 1936. Ford and company's use of shadows and light in the film is particularly engaging and

20693,"An excellent movie. Superb acting by Mary Alice, Phillip M. Thomas, and a young Irene Cara. Tony King was very realistic in his role of Satin."
20694,"A remarkable example of cinematic alchemy at work, with a trite'n'turgid lump of lead script being magically converted into a choice chunk of exquisitely gleaming musical drama gold thanks to brisk direction, fresh, engaging performances, spot-on production"
20695,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've ever seen!"
20696,"One of the better movies I've seen in a long time, but not as good as it should have been. Lonette McKee steals the show."
20697,"A romantic drama based on three sisters who had desires to become a famous girl group. In their endeavors, the oldest sister meets a drug dealer and street hustler called Satin, whom Sister goes after because she believes he is the ""big time"

20699,"The Life and Time of Little Richard, as told by Little Richard, as produced and directed by Little Richard, was about as one sided as one of his songs"
20700,"Great Movie, Great Actors, Great Story, Great Performances, Great Performances, Great Performances by Leon Robinson, Great Performances by the Actors!"
20701,Leon's best Little Richard movie yet - and it's not just for the Little Richard purists - it's for the whole family too!
20702,Little Richard is a very good TV film............
20703,The man could sing the drawers off the ladies and defined rock and roll. He won the battle and there is no one else that has his voice or his style.
20704,"Tressa's vocal performance was Outstanding!! Tressa if you read this commit, please take my advice and start recording a CD. If not just for the love of singing, but for your fans."
20705,The King of Rock-N-Roll will always be the King of Rock-N-Roll. He will always be the King of Rock-N-Roll as far as I am concerned regardless of what the other media says.
20706,"I enjoyed the movie, however, I did not realize that Little Richard had so many things going on in his life. First of all I was not aware of Lucille. There is very little (hardly any) mention of females being intimately"
20707,"Get some mates over, get a few drinks in, put this film on and howl. Get some mates over, get a few drinks in, put this film on and howl."
20708,One of the best action films I've seen in a long time...and it's not just because it's Danny Trejo's best.
20709,"Action-packed, action-packed, action-packed, action-packed, action-packed, action-packed, action-packed, action-packed, action-packed, action-packed, action-packed, action-packed"
20710,"Gary Busey's a blast as ""Bulletproof"" McBain.<n>Darlanne Fluegel is a fine butt-kicking action babe."
20711,"Busey's best work by far, rent or buy it today ""butthorn!"" My vote is a perfect 10 (on the poo meter that is)"
20712,"""Invitation to Hell"" is a great metaphoric message against the big corporations, when people literally sell their souls to the devil to climb positions and earn higher salaries."
20713,"Better than the typical made-for-tv movie. INVITATION TO HELL is blessed with excellent casting (Urich, Lucci, Cassidy, McCarthy, pre-Murphy Brown Joe Regalbuto, Soleil Moon-Frye)"
20714,A classy film pulled in 2 directions. To its advantage it is directed by Wes Craven. On the downside the TV film budget shows what could have been so much more with a larger budget.
20715,Suspenseful and well-made chiller with a bitchy Susan Lucci as club chairperson. Look out for cult favorite Michael Berryman in a bit part as a valet.
20716,"One of the best TV movies I've seen in a long time. Robert Urich is a fine actor, and he makes this TV movie believable. I remember watching this film when I was 15, and when seeing it a second time my"
20717,This Movie has great fight scenes. Now its true that the acting is a little rough. But If I wanted to see a movie based on acting skills I would watch a Cheesy movie...
20718,"Not up to the standard of Drive', but still a good action flick. Bosch is magnificent......"
20719,"Gene Wilder's ""Cash"" Carter is a great TV movie, though I admit a little bias -- the more Gene Wilder in this world the better. I'd love to see numerous additional movies detailing the adventures of Larry ""Cash"""
20720,"""The Lady in Question"" is a well-acted mystery drama that reminds me of the old black-and-white Raymond Burr Perry Mason series. Both Perry and ""Cash"" kept me guessing right up to the end."
20721,One of the best mysteries I have ever seen. Gene Wilder is the genius of his generation. He just gets better and better with every film he does.
20722,"Pleasant, diverting and charming. The best part is the swing numbers, especially the rendition of My Buddy, partial but it may have been. The acting was a bit over the top in areas but the mood set by Wilder is so pleasant it"
20723,"Good sequel to Murder in a Small Town. In this one Cash and his police Lt. buddy unravel a sticky plot involving a Nazi criminal, a philanthropic witch, and a family of screw-ups and their wierdo helpers."

20726,"Wendigo is a quiet, thoughtful horror that's not afraid to creep you into a state of dread. It's not just a horror movie, it's a psychological drama."
20727,One of those unique horror films that requires a mature understanding of the word 'horror' in order for it to be appreciated. The main thing people may fail to realize that this story is told through the point of view of a little boy and
20728,"I like Jake Weber. His understated delivery is refreshing in a time of over the top performances. I liked the relationship between the father and son. The Wendigo looks silly, but it is a representation of the kid's toy and"
20729,"The Wendigo doesn't really come to life in this movie. I don't think it's that bad, but I don't think it's good."
20730,I'd take a blunted masterpiece any day over an over-produced piece of dog-poo over-compensated with too many digital effects (like most horror movies these days)
20731,"""Wendigo"" by Larry Fessenden is a thought-provoking horror film that often tenderfoot's into a somber family drama.The acting is great,the characters are well-developed and there are some bone-chilling"
20732,"It's not about stalkfests, it's about kids making sense of the world around them, and how they (and we) use myth to make sense of it all"
20733,"Not a ""monster movie"" at all, but still a good one.. a good one.. a good one.. a good one.. a good one.. a good one.. a good one."
20734,"A haunting piece that the discerning horror film fan will fall upon with gratitude. Keep your Freddys and your Jasons -- this film is in the same company as ""The Haunting"" (the original)"
20735,A film that makes you think is not one to avoid. A film that makes you think is not one to avoid. It's one to rejoice in.
20736,"Wendigo is a pretty good psychological thriller, the film has some great drama between the characters and some good creepy scenes. The Wendigo effects are good, the Deer Form reminded me a little of the Rabbit in Donnie Darko."
20737,"This is a very interesting movie. I found it very interesting. I thought the Wendigo legend was pretty cool. The acting was also great, as well as the costumes, production, photography, directing and script."
20738,"Not a ""monster movie"" at all, but still a good one.. a good one.. a good one.. a good one.. a good one.. a good one.. a good one."
20739,"It's not a horror film, it's a family drama. It's pretty damn good. So, if you can ignore that, I think you might like it. I'm giving it a 7."
20740,William Haines at his best in this comedy/drama starring Mary Brian and Jack Pickford.<n>Haines was a top-five box office star starting with this picture through 1932. He was one of the most appealing and talented actors of
20741,One of the best films I've seen in a long time - and I've seen it more than once......
20742,"I've been intrigued by this film for a while, in part because of the extremely high score here on IMDb -- a 9.0 average with over 300 votes gives it the highest rating of any accessible silent film!"
20743,"BROWN AT HARVARD--A Remake of A YANK AT OXFORD--Well Made, But Over-rated, Not Original!"
20744,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it's a romantic comedy. It's because it's romantic."
20745,"The finest achievement from Georg Wilhelm Pabst's Social Realism period, based upon a tragedy that claimed the lives of nearly 1100 French miners as a coal dust explosion deep in mines at Courrieres in northern France"
20746,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time. I've seen it many times, but I've never seen it like this."
20747,"One of the most effective docu-dramas ever filmed. -- More than 70 years later, ""Kameradschaft"" still has the strong and timeless message: A friend in need is a friend in deed."
20748,One of the best Pabst-directed films I've ever seen--but it's a shame it didn't sway public opinion.
20749,One of the most interesting films of the 20th Century. A must-see for anyone interested in the history of the mining industry and the conflict between Europe and the U.S.
20750,"Sentimental but undeniably affecting, emotional man-helping-man plea, in this case personified as German and French miners forced to be closed off from each other after the Great War thanks to a new border, leading to disillusionment on the German side"
20751,"Pabst is a poet of silent cinema and I am not sure if this is his first sound movie or not, but his poetry is there to be discovered. He isn't fussy but brings a rugged realism to the ordeal."
20752,"If you're a fan of Shaun of the Dead, you're in for a treat. If you're a fan of Fido, you're in for a treat."
20753,"The best zombie comedy since 'Shaun of the Dead', but it's not quite as good as 'Shaun of the Dead', but it's still great."
20754,"Better than 'Shawn Of The Dead', Better than 'World Preem Of Fido', Better than 'Shawn Of The Dead', Better than 'Shawn Of The Dead', Better than 'Shawn Of The Dead'"
20755,"Deadly smart, stylish, and FUNNY.brbrThe cast was ROCK SOLID. Great work by Carrie Anne Moss, Dylan Baker, Tim Blake Nelson, Billy Connelly and up and comer, Alexia Fast.br"
20756,"Fido is a sweet comedy that deserves wider recognition, especially considering the mainstream crap that is supposed to entertain us these days. This is hardly a real zombie film, but rather a sweet satire that employs the undead to point fingers."
20757,"""Fido"" is a hoot! My grades: 8.5/10 (A-) (Seen on 01/30/07) (Seen on 01/31/07)"
20758,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time! It's wickedly funny, incredibly original, incredibly great looking and it actually has depth in character and in what it says about society!"
20759,One of the best zombie movies I've seen in a long time. Billy Connolly's best role since Mrs. Brown. I rate it 9 out of 10.
20760,"Why did the people love it? It's obvious: Everybody knows zombies by now (at least the Horror fans by heart and the others through the ""Dawn of the Dead"" reinvention or Resident Evil movies etc.) br"
20761,One of the funniest films I've seen in a long time! I've seen it more than once! I've seen it more than once!
20762,One of the best zombie movies I've seen in a long time! Billy Connelly and Cariie Ann Moss are the stars of this movie! I love it!
20763,"It's not a cheapie, it's a really good film. It's a comedy. It's a clever one at that. It also is very touching in spots, with a nice spot of kindness."
20764,One of the best zombie films I've ever seen...and I've seen it a million times...and I'm still waiting for it to come out on DVD!
20765,"It's Pleasantville meets Night of the Living Dead, it's just a great concept, what does happen after a mega zombie attack? Billy Connelly did a great job as Fido and really brought a lot of life into the character."
20766,"Billy Connely is wonderful as a zombie... Carrie Ann Moss as ""Mom""?, even better. Zombie girlfriends? I thought Dawn of the Dead was good. It's kinda like Airplane meets (meats?) Night of the Living Dead"
20767,"What's not to like?--you got your zombies, you got your family issues, you got your social dilemmas, you got yourself one Fine Retro-1950's-style Flesh Eating Under Class Held At Bay By An Uneasy"
20768,One of the best zombie films I have ever seen...........
20769,One of the best zombie films I've ever seen. I've been a fan since the first time I saw it. I've watched it over and over again.
20770,"Fido is a very odd film. And in many ways, a very good one.brbrDespite its difficult tonal problems, I hope this movie finds a niche, as it's quite a little gem in this year's"
20771,"I was totally blown away. By the time I got to the theater I could remember little other than the basic plot of the movie (yes, I actually forgot who was even in it.) Terrific performances from the entire cast."
20772,"One of the best zom-coms since ""Shaun of the Dead"", but with a darker twist....."
20773,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it a few times, but never as good as this one."
20774,"One of the best zombie films I've seen in a long, long time--but why did it get an R rating? It's not about zombies, it's about kids!"
20775,"""Fido"" is a colorful, stylish, and amusingly satirical addition to zombie film lore. brbr""Fido"" doesn't go far enough into its own intriguing ""Wild Zone""; but, it is a"
20776,"A low-key, subtle little satire that elicits appreciative chuckles rather than full-bellied guffaws. Much of the humor derives from the incongruity between the placidness of the setting and the cavalier attitude towards death"
20777,"""Fido"" is a daring black comedy that succeeds where so many others have failed. Highly recommended. Make no mistake, this is a daring black comedy that succeeds where so many others have failed."
20778,"One of the best zombie movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best zombie movies I've seen in a long time."
20779,"Aparadektoi, the best Greek Comedy series ever! Lefteris Papapetrou writes and Antonis Aggelopoulos directs in a magnificent way Soso, Alekos, Flora, Achilleas, Grandpa Aristides"
20780,"Eglimata, Eglimata, Eglimata, Eglimata, Eglimata, Eglimata, Eglimata, Eglimata, Eglimata, Eglimata, Eglimata, Eglimata,"
20781,Eglimata is one of the best Greek TV series ever!It's a story about little crimes everyday people commit that in a crazy scenario could lead to the absolute disaster.One of the smartest Greek series ever!
20782,Very well acted and very slow paced............
20783,"I enjoyed it because I wasn't expecting what I was seeing, but an ordinary sex-drama so.... It's a pscyho-sexual thriller, in which nothing is what it seems."
20784,Paul Winfield ends his career with a decent telefilm. What an actor. He will be missed. A decent telefilm to help send Paul Winfield off to celluloid heaven.
20785,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and I've seen it many times before......"
20786,"Robert Hossein's best film, a must see for all lovers of jazz and suspense........."
20787,"""Toi le Venin"" is Robert Hossein's masterpiece,and one of the great thrillers of the fifties.Based on a Frederic Dard novel,a writer the director often worked with (see also ""le Monte-Charge"""
20788,"If this has been converted to DVD - in Region 2 format - and in the original French language, I would love to hear about it & where it can be purchased"
20789,"The vigilante has long held a fascination for audiences. It is, in fact, one of the things that has made the character of Dirty Harry Callahan so popular."
20790,"Another Thrill Ride through the Life of Dirty Harry Callahan. This time Harry attempts to solve a series of murders while on vacation. Clint Eastwood plays Harry as he plays all his men of action, slow, deliberate, and without fear."
20791,One of the most disgusting female characters I've ever seen on film.....and I've seen it more than once!.....and I've seen it more than once!
20792,"It's time to get back to Dirty Harry's roots, but it's not quite as good as ""Magnum Force""<n>Clint Eastwood makes the first well-directed Harry film since Don Siegel made the first."
20793,"Not as good as the first two, but still an excellent addition to the Dirty Harry series, even if it was getting a little out of place during a time of silly fashion trends and New Wave music."
20794,"The Enforcer is the best out of the series, but it doesn't get the dirty and gritty impact that the other two do. This film captures all the excitement that makes a Clint Eastwood film good."
20795,"""Go ahead -- make my day"" -- make my day -- make my day -- make my day -- make my day -- make my day -- make my day -- make my day -- make my day -- make my day -- make my day"
20796,"One of Eastwood's best, but it's not quite as good as the first two 'Harry's's'<n>Locke's performance is the strongest part of the film"
20797,"""Go ahead, make my day"" is a great line, but not as good as you'd expect from a ""Dirty Harry"" sequel.."
20798,One of the most satisfying films I've seen in a long time.........
20799,"An intriguing addition to the ""Dirty Harry"" series. It's mediocre and silly in parts, brilliant and classic in others, with compelling, gripping pacing."
20800,"Not as good as the original, but still a good one :P :p :p :p :p :p :p :p :p :p :p :p"
20801,"Sudden Impact is a good action movie. Eastwood makes the role his and the movie is mainly more action then talk, not that I'm complaining. Sudden Impact is indeed enjoyable entertainment."
20802,"One of the better 'Dirty Harry's', but not as good as 'Magnum Force's' or 'The Enforcer's'"
20803,"Very nice entry into the Dirty Harry series of movies. Still, very nice entry into the Dirty Harry series of movies. Still, very nice entry into the series."
20804,Not the best but the one with the most remembered line. Go Ahead Make your day. Go Ahead Make your day. Go Ahead Make your day. Go Ahead Make your day.
20805,Clint Eastwood returns as Dirty Harry Calahan in the 4th movie of the Dirty Harry series. Clint is older but he's still got it. Harry was told to have a vacation after some trouble that happened because of a robbery (where
20806,"""Sudden Impact"" is the grittiest, dirtiest and downright dirtiest of all ""Dirty Harry"" films. Clint Eastwood is brilliant in the role of Harry Callahan."
20807,"Better than The Enforcer, but not as good as the first two movies........"
20808,"""Sudden Impact"" retains all the elements that made the previous three Dirty Harry movies so successful- tight pacing, compelling plot, strong supporting characters, endless gunplay, and bone-dry humor."
20809,"""Make my day...You feel lucky, Punk?...."" classic Eastwood as only Eastwood, with his anguished, rubbery expressions, and whispery, menacing voice can do it"
20810,Sudden Impact is an awfully well made film. It really shows how mature Eastwood is as a director. And if I remember correctly it was actually the first time Eastwood put that on screen albeit in an action film of ideology.
20811,"Not as good as the other Eastwood movies, but still a good one........."
20812,"Dirty Harry is back, older, more dirtier and grittier than ever since the original 1971 classic.brbrSudden Impact brings a new meaning and more darker tone to Dirty Harry."
20813,"An Action-packed story set again in San Francisco and Santa Cruz. The chief rapist, played by Andy Drake is suitably vile and gets his punishment at the end (of course!)"
20814,"Not as good as the first two, but still a good movie. What Sudden Impact needed was a plot like in Wall Street but with Dirty Harry in middle."
20815,"This is not the worst Harry movie I've ever seen, but it's not the worst either. I've seen a lot of bad movies, and this one is not one of them."
20816,"Sudden Impact is the best of the five Dirty Harry movies. They don't come any leaner and meaner than this as Harry romps through a series of violent clashes, with the bad guys getting their just desserts."
20817,"""Go ahead, make my day, make my day, make my day, make my day, make my day, make my day, make my day, make my day, make my day, make my day, make my day"""

20819,Star Trek: The Next Generation - The Ood is the best of the new series - and the best of the old ones too.......
20820,"Not as good as the TV series, but still a great watch.........."
20821,"What can I say? An excellent end to an excellent series! It never quite got the exposure it deserved in Asia, but by far, the best cop show with the best writing and the best cast on televison. EVER!"
20822,"Homicide: The Movie proved to be a good wrap-up to a well-written, well-directed, and well-acted series. Loose ends were tied up that weren't properly addressed at the end of the final season."
20823,"The Last Super Episode of ""HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET"" (1993-99) is a great TV Movie, but not as good as the original series"
20824,"My favourite police series of all time turns to a TV-film. Does it work? Yes. Gee runs for mayor and gets shot. The Homicide ""hall of fame"" turns up. Pembleton and nearly all of the cops"
20825,"A great ending to a great series. I enjoyed this movie a lot. The movie did its job and did it very well, presenting a great depiction of life after Al retired, and the family relationship that existed between the unit."
20826,"Not as good as the series, but still a good movie. But not as good as it could have been. Bayless is the only reason for the ending."
20827,"It's time to say goodbye to this series, and it's time to end it on a high note......"
20828,"One of the best Homicide movies I've ever seen, but it's not all it's cracked up to be. It's not all it's cracked up to be."
20829,"Homicide, Life on the Streets, Network drama at its BEST!!!! Thumbs UP and all That. Thanks NBC for giving us the Finally we didn't get!"
20830,"Good, but not as good as the other H:LOTS movies. I liked this one more than the others, but not as much as the others."
20831,This movie was better than all the other H:LOTS movies I have ever seen!brbr I just LOVED being able to enter the world of the Baltimore Homicide Squad again!
20832,"""Homicide: The Maniac Movie"" aka ""Life Everlasting"" is a fan flick, but stands on its own as well as any 2-hour episode of the series"
20833,One of the best Homicide movies I've ever seen. I've been a fan of the show for years. I'm glad it's coming to an end.
20834,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Worth seeing when you put the movie in it's proper context. Worth seeing when you put the movie in it's proper context.
20835,"One of the best films I've ever seen, and one of the best actors I've ever seen. I can't wait to see it again."
20836,"One of the few truly ""independent"" films produced in the last ten years, no studio had faith in the picture and it was never picked up for major distribution"
20837,Angela Bassett at her best as a woman forced to live on a desolate mudbank in South Africa......
20838,"An absorbing analysis of exploitation and despair in a situation where there is no way forward or up, where the attempts to make yourself feel better by violating and putting down whoever is below you seems to be the only option."
20839,"One of the best-sustained Zatoichi series in movie history, but it's not quite as good as some of the other ones. The plot and characters seem too complicated for the series at this point."
20840,"One of the oddest films of the Zatichi series, but it ends very well. brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr"
20841,"Zatoichi The Outlaw is a slightly lesser entry in the series, but it packs a sweetly satisfying dose of entertainment and decent doses of Zatoichi's quirky cool."
20842,I finally watched these episodes in 2008 and I had to continually go back and verify when they were actually produced. They are absolutely scary in that they made spot on fun of what would be the future.
20843,"Trey Parker and Matt Stone's That's My Bush is a pretty funny spoof of sitcoms and political satire.It was cancelled after one season, not because of bad reviews, but because it was very expensive."
20844,"Thats My Bush is a very entertaining show, but it's not a great show. brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr"
20845,One of the best movies ever made about the Russian Revolution..........
20846,One of Josef Von Sternberg's best films. Emil Jannings won an Oscar for his role in this silent classic. William Powell makes his big screen debut as the Hollywood director who casts Jannings in his film.
20847,"One of Jannings's best performances, but a little over-dramatised by Sternberg's film-making style... and Powell's acting."
20848,The Last Command (1928) is a very good silent drama.Emil Jannings does memorable role work in the lead.Evelyn Brent is wonderful playing the woman lead.William Powell is great as always.
20849,"'The Last Command' is a great film, but it's not quite as good as 'The Docks of New York' or 'Underworld'"
20850,"A very good film, even if it's not quite as good as the sound version would have been. I still consider WINGS to be a superior film, but this one is excellent despite a little bit of overacting by the lead"

20877,"My first Fassbinder was a wonderful experience. Film and alternative cinema (small hall, with uncomfortable seats; public had to wait while filmrolls were changed) were perfect match."

20910,Depardieu's best performance in a very difficult role. Miou-Miou is lovely throughout and again has very difficult scenes to play. In the end this uncompromising and daring film demands respect.
20911,Is it the same car they steal much later from the picnicking family? We know the original owner sold it. A whole new slant to the end of the film
20912,"One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time, but it's not pro-gay or pro-feminist at all."

20915,Depardieu's best early work. A must-see for any Depardieu fan. A stunning piece that will convince even the most skeptical viewer that shocks Depardieu is one of the finest film actors of the last 50 years
20916,"'Les Valseuses' gives me a picture close to my own experiences: the intenseness of each moment as soon as you leave 'all behind' and go for the momentous, whatever comes your way, it's another state"
20917,The French can't get away with films like this. Dare I say that only the French can get away with films like this. And that is part of their genius.
20918,"Depardieu's most notorious film is this (1974)groundbreaker from Bertrand Blier. It features many highly sexual scenes verging on an X-rating, including one of Jeanne Moreau doing a hot 1970s version of her Jules and Jim"

20927,One of the funniest romantic comedies I've seen in a long time...and it's not just because it stars Meg Ryan...it's because it's Albert Einstein!
20928,"I.Q., in my opinion, is a sweet, charming, and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you. You're in for lots of laughter, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it"
20929,It's so cute and it's a movie I'll watch over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over

20937,What a delightful romp  a very competently made film that has so much charm and a feelgood factor that a lot of romantic comedies don't.
20938,"A solid, if unremarkable film. Matthau, as Einstein, was wonderful. I loved the scene with the physicists playing badmitton, I loved the sweaters and the conversation while they waited for Robbins to retrieve the birdie"
20939,One of the best feel-good movies I've seen. Hopefully the DVD will be out soon. Hopefully it's just one of the best feel-good movies I've seen.
20940,A great romantic comedy! Historically inaccurate (Einstein had no nieces or nephews as noted elsewhere in IMDb) but he made a great matchmaker. He brought together two very nice people played by two of the best actors working.
20941,"A light comedy about the life of Albert Einstein, but it's still worth seeing......."
20942,"Wonderfully sweet and daffy, a must-see for Einstein fans and non-Einstein fans alike. A must-see for any Einstein fan. Walter Matthau is brilliant as Einstein."

20946,"A pleasant film, even if the premise is silly. It was sort of a guilty pleasure to watch. Meg Ryan seems to be able to pull off roles in this kind of film (another example is Joe vs. the Volcano)"

20951,"Not as good as the first, but not as bad as the animated classic which I found more poignant and endearing. The best asset as it was with the first film is Glenn Close in a deliciously over-the-top performance as Cruella"

20958,"If you like animal movies, this movie will please. My wife likes animals and animal movies, she especially like the parrot in this film. It is geared towards kids, but I laughed at most of the humor."
20959,"An important landmark for the Romanian cinema, and for the process of recovering the moral and historic values in the Romanian society, as well as for the process of recovering the moral and historic values in the Romanian society"
20960,"A movie filled with passion, fear, sexuality, all the great ingredients for a great movie recipe.One of the greatest Romanian movies,despite its psychological charge(after all, it is an European movie)"

20963,Drew Barrymore is excellent in this film. This role is the type of role you don't normally see Drew play. Her typical role is as a woman looking for love.

20970,it's not gonna be a classic but it's still funny and it's still a slice of the pie franchise....
20971,This is by far one of my favorite of the American Pie Spin offs mainly because in most of the others the main character (one of the young Stiflers) always seems unrealistic in nature.
20972,"Don't expect the classic American Pie, but expect something that will make you laugh and spark your attention for an hour or so. Don't expect the classic American Pie, but expect something that will make you laugh and spark your attention"

20983,"It's funny how your life can change in a second, and it's a film that doesn't get to leave us indifferent to the message that is transmitted..."
20984,Touching and sad movie. Portrays the trials and tribulations of a writer trying to come to terms with paralysis caused by a cycling accident. Get out the box of kleenex and watch this on a cosy Sunday afternoon with your partner.
20985,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time - and I've seen it more than once.....
20986,"An excellent and very honest portrayal of paralysis and racism. This movie never panders to the audience and never gets predictable. The acting was top-notch and the movie reminded me of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"""
20987,"""The Waterdance"" is a great movie, but the movie industry is on the decline. Im not ""stuck in a time warp"", im not saying that everything during the 80s and early 90s was better than today,"
20988,"This is a bold look into the mindset of men who find themselves in wheelchairs. This film never tries to tone it down, cotton candy-ize, or soft soap the angst, confusion, and pain of what these guys live with."
20989,"Eric Stoltz, Wesley Snipes, William Forsythe, Helen Hunt, and Grace Zabriskie are all outstanding in this touching drama about the human spirit"
20990,"It's not bad, but it's not the best Lupin movie I've seen so far....."
20991,"A nice change of pace for Lupin, with Fujiko and Lara in fine form. A good movie for fans of the series, but not as good as the other Lupins."
20992,"Good for the Made-For-Backwoods-Cable-TV genre, but not as good as it could have been.<n>The actress who played the babysitter, Mariana Klaveno, was very good!"
20993,"A very funny, clever British comedy. Not sure why it doesn't play in Peoria, apparently, but this is a very funny, clever British comedy. Peter Sellars is fantastic as the rich, forty-something serial womaniser."
20994,Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn are the stars of this movie..........
20995,One of my all-time favorite movies... but it's not quite as good as I'd like it to be... but it's still great!
20996,I've seen most of the children's videos in our collection at least 72 times. I can tell you when the film gets reversed in The Wizard of Oz...
20997,One of the funniest movies I've ever seen! Chris Showerman did a great job as George! A great movie for the whole family to watch!
20998,"Fun Sequel to the 1st Sequel, but it's not as good as the 1st, but it's still fun to watch."
20999,A great movie for the whole family. It's a great movie for the whole family. It's a great movie for the whole family. It's a great movie. It's a great movie for the whole family.

21001,"A refreshing change from the other things shown late at night, if you catch my drift. Its simplicity of values and sweetness of hearts helps remind me of the way friendships were as children."
21002,One of the best children's shows I've seen in a long time........
21003,"I thought it was pretty good. I enjoyed the acting and it moved along well. The director seemed to really grasp the story he was trying to tell. I have to see the big budget one coming out today, obviously they had a lot"
21004,"The Music Dark, Jerry Goldsmith, would have applauded this Movie.brbrI collect horror Movies and Soundtracks, So listen to what I have to say, not that other idiot.brbrThere is only one thing"

21012,"One of the best ""Spring Break""umentary's I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it missed the theaters."
21013,"One of Whistler's last films, and it's worth watching over and over again as usual to fans of the genre like me. The Whistler radio series begun in 1942 carried on until 1955 clocking up nearly 700 half hour shows, nearly"
21014,"Not as good as the other 'Whistler' films, but it's still a good one. I'll recommend it for at least a single viewing."

21017,"I'd really like to own the movie since the reason I watched it in the first place is because I am a bus driver and at the time I saw this movie, I was driving that model bus."
21018,"Not just a classic, but one of the best 3D games of the 80's, if you can call it that.<n>Not just a classic, but one of the best stealth games of all time."

21020,One of the best movies ever made about American workers in the post-war era.<n>One of the best movies ever made about Japanese workers in the post-war era.
21021,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. Don't be fooled by the low number rating. This is a 7.5 in my book. It is interesting to note that the town name of Hadleyville was also used
21022,"Great example of the differences between two cultures. I thought it was pretty funny and i must say that i am a sucker for that ""lets band together and get the job done"" plot device."
21023,"Good, but not great, but still fun to watch..........."
21024,"A very funny east-meets-west film influenced by the closure of GM's Flint, Michigan plant in the eighties and the rise and integration of Japanese automakers in the US"
21025,A wonderful movie with a clever story and the dynamics of culture differences and the running theme of what's important in life make this a very under-appreciated movie. Don't let the cynics of the world deter you from seeing this
21026,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once.
21027,"It's been years since I last saw this movie. Watching it in 2008 is certainly different than watching it in 1986. It was great that the town got to keep there jobs and keep the factory, but what was most special was the marriage"
21028,Ron Howard's 'Gung Ho' still offers hard truth for industrial life today.<n>Ron Howard's 'Gung Ho' still has its comic value.
21029,I'm surprised to see some of the low ratings for this movie. It's more of a subtle comedy rather than a all-out comedy farce. I also find some of those that felt this was an inaccurate film on cultural and
21030,this is a great film!!! I first saw this film when it came out. I just recently saw this film again and it still holds up to my memory of it. A lot of films we watched when we were younger don't seem
21031,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. Keaton & Watanabe are great together......
21032,One of the best movies I've ever seen about Japan-U.S. trade relations......
21033,"This movie is a must see for anyone in business or who just wants to have a laugh. brbrWell, that's about it! Cheers"
21034,"""Gung Ho"" is a great movie to learn about Japan and Japan's culture. I wish I could get a clean-up TV version."
21035,"I just have to throw my two cents in. Relax, it's a comedy. Yes for the most part the characters are broadly written and acted. I can't think of many comedies where they aren't."
21036,"I remember watching ""Gung Ho"" as a child with my mother, and wondered why she would always cry in the last few minutes. I, of course, found the entire movie hilarious..."
21037,I really enjoyed this movie. Typically Ron Howard who seems to like being associated with Michael Keaton. Love the scene when Hunt travels to Japan with his sales pitch
21038,"Gung Ho tries to express many ideas and entertain us with a wiseguy comedy at the same time. The result is uneven, but generally entertaining. Keaton balances all three aspects of his lead character quite well."
21039,"""Singing in the Bathtub"" is an absolutely amazing production number that must be seen-- be sure to wear your shower cap!<n>This is hardly a movie at all, but rather a real vaudeville show, filmed for the most part """
21040,"A must for ""film buffs"" especially interested in the silent to sound transition..... but over all reasonably entertaining, and a must for ""film buffs"" especially interested in the silent to sound transition"
21041,This is a deliriously colossal silly all star revue of all the early talkie stars that Warner Bros could afford....and like most other rarely seen films...
21042,"""Show of Shows"" was a revue filmed to compete with MGM's successful ""Hollywood Revue of 1929"", which still survives intact complete with its Technicolor scenes."
21043,One of the best early-talkies films I have ever seen. A must-see for any old-movie buff......
21044,"""Chirin No Suzu"" is one of the best films I've seen in a long time......"

21048,"Return to Boggy Creek is not a sequel to the Boggy Creek Legend, it's a fantasy movie for kids based on the Boggy Creek Legend"
21049,"a cute kids movie,no real violence a few mild scares but good fun for the young......"
21050,"Charmingly pleasant and tenderhearted sequel to the hugely successful ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" is a follow-up in name only.<n>The adorable Dawn Wells gives an engagingly plucky portrayal of the kids' loving working class single mom"
21051,"it was a great movie for kids.dawn wells from gilligans island,and promise shown of a barely then known dana plato.it was disneylike and for that it can hardly be disregarded as meaningless fluff.no"

21053,"Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation Is a Great Movie, And Peter Lorre's Great Performance Is a Great One. I'm a sucker for 1930s Mystery Movies."
21054,"I love these 1930 mystery/police Charlie Chan type movies, but something seems bad with this one. A late attempt to switch from cerebral Moto movies centered around the plot contrivances to a salad bar spoilt by comedy relief that is as relieving"
21055,"A surprisingly interesting meditation on the nature of regret in terms of the way it relates to paranoia. There's a lot going on in this for having a run time of only 74 minutes, but it works."
21056,I liked this movie because it basically did more with less. It could have been made more interesting if they had kept it confined to the studio even more.
21057,"Like TALK RADIO, THE BOOTH is kinda predictable. That's not necessarily a bad thing, in this case. It means, that the filmmakers don't punk out in the end the way they might've in..."

21059,"Gundam Wing is the most successful of the entire Gundam Series. With cutting-edge Anime animation, stunning action, amazing Mobile Suits, Breathtaking scripts, and some of the most unforgettable characters in Anime History."
21060,"Mobile Suit Gundam Wing is one of the best animes I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it's the 4th series in the series."
21061,One of the best anime series I've seen in a long time..but it gets a bit too mellow-dramatic for its own good..
21062,"The English version of Gundam Wing(2000) is very different from the Japanese version of Gundam Wing(1995) in terms of plot, script and characters."
21063,"Enjoyable, but not as good as previous Gundams..... Wing has great suit designs......."
21064,"One of the best anime series I've seen in a very long time. brbrI'm not a big fan of most anime, but this is one of the best. brbrGundam Wing"
21065,"One of the most enjoyable and unique Gundam series out there. I recommend it to any fan of anime, or sci-fi in general. The characters are so well drawn out by the end of the show that you end up loving each and"
21066,"A bit slow moving (especially around the middle of the series), but over all enjoyable. Now before anyone jumps on my case and calls me a ""winger"", I will admit that I have watched all of the original Gundam, Gundam"
21067,One of the best animes I've seen in a long time. I've watched almost all of the Gundam/Mech anime that have showed in the US and this by far has the best story.
21068,"One of the best anime series I've seen in a long time, and one of the best anime series I've seen in a long time."
21069,One of the best of the alternate universe Gundam tales. brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
21070,One of the best anime series I've seen in a long time.........
21071,"One of the best, if not the best, anime series of all time, but it's not quite as good as it could have been......"
21072,"The best anime series I've ever seen,and it's still the best of the best.And it's still the best of the best.And it's still the best of the best."
21073,The ending was really shocking to everyone in attendance & the ones who were watching at home. Was'nt really bad for Raw's first PPV of 006. But the ending was really shocking to everyone in attendance & the ones who were
21074,"Homicide: The Movie is as good as a made-for-television film can be. It's a terrific TV movie. The intensity and fire that marked the series return, and the script bristles with the same fire that marked the"
21075,"One of the most powerful 2 hours of television I've ever seen. It was great to see everyone back again, but the biggest pleasure of all was to have Andre Braugher back"
21076,"Not what I expected, but a very good surprise indeed. I'll definitely buy this movie when it comes out on DVD. I'll definitely buy this movie when it comes out on DVD."
21077,"A boy with a gift and a curse in one package - he was capable of withdrawing sword from his arm. There was always a wound on his wrist in the cause of this ""gift"" - the wound of the deadliest weapon inside of his"
21078,It's a bit like a Greek tragedy - whatever the main character does it always goes wrong somehow. So basically you need to be very patient in order to watch it.
21079,"RUSSAIN w ENG subtitles.. slick worth a watch.. but it falters at the end as the story twists get a little bit extreme.. but all in all, I would recommend this movie just because it has that"
21080,"This movie is outrageous, funny, ribald, sophisticated & hits the bullseye where 99 % of Hollywood movies don't even make the target. Paul Bartel should be recognized as one of the great directors of this or any era."
21081,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it over and over again. I've seen it over and over again.
21082,"Funny play on sex, family, and the classes in Beverly Hills milks more laughs out of the zip code than it's seen since the days of Granny and Jed Clampett"
21083,"One of the unsung gems of the 1980's, Scenes... features razor-sharp satire and outstanding performances from Arnetia Walker (how did she not get a ton of roles after this?)and Wallace Shawn"
21084,Mary Moronov is the hottest woman on screen. 9 out of 10. I maybe biased about this movie. 9 out of 10. This's the only movie I own on original tape.
21085,Spitting Image is one of the best TV-shows of all time. I wish I could see the show again. Is it possible to purchase it from someone... somewhere?
21086,"One of the best shows I've ever seen, and still watch it over and over again. I wish there was a DVD release for this one."
21087,"I'm planning on returning home sometime soon and will try to record the tape onto my computer so that those who want a copy can do so. If anyone of you would like to contact me, I think you can do that through the"
21088,L'amour  mort is like a game which is not at all didactic.It is a film in which the musical score is in perfect tandem with its images.This is one of the reasons why this film can easily be grasped

21093,"The second official episode of the ""Columbo"" series hit the airwaves first. Robert Culp, who would match wits with Peter Falk's detective in several future installments, is terrific as the short-tempered head of a sophisticated private detective agency"
21094,"One of the better Columbo movies out of the long running series of movies. Robert Culp is truly great as the short temperedmer. Funny thing is that he would later star in three different Columbo movies again and one ""Mrs. Col"
21095,"One of the first and best Columbos. Robert Culp and Ray Milland starred in this one. Robert Culp appeared on another Columbo, as did several other villains, including Patrick McGoohan, William Shatner, and Jack Cassidy"
21096,"""Death Lends A Hand"" is one of the pivotal early episodes of ""Columbo"" that helped define the show for the next thirty years. It marks the first of Robert Culp's four appearances (three as a murderer)"
21097,"I don't care for this one at all. Maybe I just didn't care for this one at all. Of course, Columbo gets him in the end."
21098,One of the most visually stunning cartoons I've seen in a long time........
21099,"""To Spring"" is a lost classic from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's short cartoon era. What is even more remarkable is that this cartoon's director made his debut here. And who is ""To Spring""'s director"
21100,"If you're a fan, you'll probably enjoy this one. If you don't know who Misty Mundae is, you'll probably enjoy ""That 70's Girl"", ""Vampire Vixens"", or ""Er"
21101,Butch the peacemaker? Evidently. Evidently... I found it fun to watch. I can a million of these cartoons in which every beats each other over the head.
21102,"One of the best Tom & Jerry's short films, but it's not as good as you'd think. I'd give it 5 stars if I could."

21107,"WWE's last PPV of 2006 proved to be a hit with the fans, but for one reason only, the ladder match which was only scheduled to be Paul London and Brian Kendrick against William Regal and Dave Taylor"

21110,If you don't have any real friends to go to a party with than you could do worse than to sit in and watch this. I believe the minimal sound design and cheap camera is a conscious decision rather than bad film making.
21111,"Leos Carax's ""Young Lovers"" is the most unique film I've seen in a long time....."
21112,"""Mean Frank and Crazy Tony"" deserves a proper and luxurious DVD edition. Heck, I don't even need the restored picture quality and bonus features if only we could watch the film in its original language."

21114,Not as good as I thought it would be but it's still worth a look...........
21115,"One of the best Italian gangster films of the last decade, and it's not just because it stars Lee Van Cleef and Tony Lo Bianco. It's because it's directed by Michele Lupo."
21116,"""Rich in Love"" is a slice-of-life film which takes the viewer into the goings on of a somewhat quirky Charleston, SC family."
21117,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time and I've seen it again and again. I'll give it 5 stars if I see it again.
21118,"Kathryn Erbe is hard to like in this movie and why I recommend it as a 10 star for Criminal Intent, law and order fans. Albert Finney is hard to like in this movie and why I recommend it as a 10 star for Criminal"

21128,"Kalifornia came out in 1993, just as 3 of the 4 lead characters were up and coming to the levels of fame they now possess in 2006. This is a nice psycho-thriller that should appeal to all David Duchovny fans because of"
21129,Kalifornia is a diamond in the rough and a very intriguing journey with a serial killer. Great performances all around by the leads with Pitt in particular being exceptional. Check it out!!
21130,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time. I'm not a fan of Brad Pitt, but I'm glad I did."
21131,Kalifornia is a movie about lost ideals. A journey on the darkest road ever. The road of no return. You'll think again before taking some stranger in your car to share the gas with!
21132,"Not as good as I thought it would be, but it's still a good movie......."
21133,"Pitt, Lewis, Duchovny, and Forbes make Kalifornia a good slasher flick. It doesn't come better than TV Too Young To Die."
21134,'Kalifornia' is as unnerving and watchable as it was ten or so years ago. I am pleased to say that it is every bit as unnerving and watchable as it was ten or so years ago.
21135,"A masterpiece to be recorded in the books and never forgotten. A classic in time. A solid, worth-while, very entertaining piece. A good movie, but there are some uneven elements or noticeable flaws."
21136,This Was One Scary Movie. Brad Pitt Deserved an Oscar for this.brbrThis Was One Scary Movie. David Duchovny Deserved an Oscar for this.
21137,Pitt and Lewis are outstanding as the genuinely chill inspiring Early Grayce and Juliette Lewis is capably backed up by Lewis playing her customary white trash character that seems to be her default setting.
21138,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time! I can't believe I haven't seen the end! I can't believe I've seen it!

21140,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I'm not a big Brad fan but this is a great movie. I give it a 9 out of 10.
21141,"Not the greatest flick in the world, but it's not bad...I watched what was supposed to be the 'unrated' version but I wonder how much was cut out of the rated version, because this seemed fairly tame to me"

21149,"""Der Todesking"" is one of the most powerful movies I've seen in a long time, but it's not for the faint of heart."
21150,Der Todesking (The Death King) is one of the best horror films ever made. It shows how fragile life is and how short our lives are. It reduces its viewers to the childs they (we) actually are.
21151,"""Der Todesking""-Jorg Buttgereit's second full-length feature film(the first one was notorious ""Nekromantik"")has no central character or characters,but instead thematic continuity in the act"
21152,One of the best movies I've ever seen. Buttgereit's masterpiece is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
21153,"One of Jrg Buttgereit's most disturbing films. Buttgereit's second cult monument in a row is better than ""Nekromantik"""
21154,"Jrg Buttgereit's work is always something special and hard to classify. This movie is a perfect example of his work. It's not really a movie with a story to it, in a sense of having"

21159,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time..........
21160,"I remember seeing this movie in my early childhood, I couldn't read the subtitles and I thought Sonny Chiba was Sean Connery. But I did really like the concept."
21161,"A surprisingly good sci-fi actioner, but it's a forgivable flaw in a surprisingly good sci-fi actioner.Optimum's UK DVD is a good transfer of the uncut 138-minute version."

21166,"Diane Keaton is at her best in these roles that walk the thread between drama and comedy and her presence holds the story together. Yes, this story has been told many times - the impact of sudden death on the lives of those whose privacy is"
21167,"I disagree with the other comments posted on this movie. For instance, the movie is based on the book and if the writer had a gay character in it then how could ""Hollywood"" just throw in a token gay character in..."
21168,A very thought provoking film with Diane Keaton as the main character.<n>A very touching performance from Diane Keaton as the mother of the girl at the center of the story.
21169,"An outstanding performance by Diane Keaton in this rather sad but funny story which involved quite a few young people and their deep dark secrets. Great film to view and enjoy, especially all the good acting from all the supporting actors."
21170,One of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. Have recommended it to all my friends!! I could see myself having a daughter and doing the same things that Natalie did to find out more about her life and loves.

21173,"It's a surreal comedy--tremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove. It's a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances, especially by our angel."
21174,Surreal 40s musical that showcases MacDonald's comic abilities. Surreal 40s musical seem to be making fun of 40s fashions even as they were in current vogue. Eye-popping costumes and sets (yes B&W) add
21175,"It's a feel-good movie, and it's a great musical! I'd say you'd like this one! I'd say you'd like this one!"

21178,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, exotic and fantastic. Jeanette wore it well, and got even with naive Nelson. costume outfits of his female mafia were designed surprisingly well, especially by today's standards. 1942 costume designer did great job."
21179,"Not as good as I thought it would be, but it's still a good thriller. Don't expect too many twists and fireworks. Leave your expectations outside and enjoy the ride."
21180,"escapist entertainment with the Beltway as the backdrop. Nevertheless, this is a fun film, escapist entertainment with the escapist"
21181,An interesting look into the lives of the most powerful people in the world.<n>Keifer Sutherland and Eva Longoria don't live up to their billing
21182,"An excellent political thriller about something that's never happened before - a Secret Service agent going bad and involved in an assassination plot. Unfortunately, for Michael Douglas' character, they think HE's the mole but he isn't."
21183,"The sentinel is not great but it's very fun and action scenes are very well done.This movie reminded me TV series like 24 or Alias.It's very similar to that series and it reminded me too,to the Wolfgang"

21185,The Sentinel is a good film and i would recommend it.Michael Douglas in this film is very good and Keither Sutherland is very good in this film.
21186,"The Sentinel is a solid thriller with some good acting, good pacing, and some good plot twists. Worth a viewing if you like the genre. Worth a viewing if you like the genre. Worth a viewing if you like the genre."
21187,"Unsubstantiated plot, poor acting, and a lack of depth. Disappointing........"
21188,"Good, but not the best movie I've seen in a long, long time......."
21189,"Not as good as the TV series, but not as bad as it could have been......."
21190,"Not as good as the TV show,but entertaining enough to keep you watchable and interested.<n>The DVD extras seemed more insightful and interesting than the movie,though the film itself was entertaining enough to keep most (myself included) interested"
21191,The Sentinel is a good political thriller movie which seems similar to or even borrows some elements from other political thriller movies such as In the Line of Fire and The Manchurian Candidate
21192,A good old-fashioned political thriller with a few genuine moments of excitement.<n>Michael Douglas is the perfect man for the job as a Secret Service agent.
21193,"One of the best movies i've seen in a long time, Kiefer Sutherland is the star, Michael Douglas is the star, Eva Longoria is the houswife"
21194,"""Sergeant Ryker"" is one of the best courtroom dramas I've ever seen. Marvin Marvin's performance is the highlight of the film."
21195,"Sergeant Ryker is accused of being a traitor during the Korean War, a hanging offense. A long drawn out court-marshal ensues and that time the Sgt. must remain in a military jail. Very good picture"
21196,One of the finest courtroom dramas of the 1950's..........
21197,"Thomas Ian Griffith, Donald Southerland, and Tia Carrer are the stars of this movie. Very funny and action packed. A great addition to my DVD collection."
21198,One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. All of you who regard this movie as absolute sh*t obviusly are not intelligent enough to grasp all of the subtle humor that this movie has to offer.

21200,"It's a good movie, but it's not a great movie. It's a good movie, but it's not a great movie."
21201,"One of the finest B-movies of the 90s. If you're looking for some action, look elsewhere. However, if you're looking for some laughs, this is well worth watching."
21202,"I think Hollow Point is a funny film with some good moments I have never seen before in action movies. Well,both Tia Carrere and Thomas Ian Griffith aren't so good in acting, but Tia Carrere is nice and"

21204,"""EASILY GIVE AWAY VIRGINITY""? WHAT A SHREWD REMARKABLE REMARKABLE REMARK ABOUT THIS FILM. TRULY."
21205,This is a masterpiece footage in B/W 35mm film. The film makes you see a strange way to begin the day at 7:35 am in a bar and how much things can happen there in 8 minutes.
21206,What Nacho Vigalondo is able to do in 8 minutes is beyond what most directors are able to do in hours of film. What Nacho is able to convey in 8 minutes takes some Hollywood directors hours of film to achieve.
21207,"I was so glad I came across this short film. I'm always so disappointed that short films are hard to come across, so when I saw this and saw that it was nominated for the Live Action Short Film at the Academy Awards,"
21208,"Nacho Vigalondo is the discovery of the year for his one-man show: the most remarkable effort I've seen in years. Also pay attention to the performance of Marta Belenguer, her reaction shots are incredible."

21214,"Can a movie really be considered a ""bad"" movie? The answer is yes, but it's definitely not a waste of your time or money."
21215,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it a few times, but I've never seen it like this."
21216,"It's not all that bad. But then again, this movie genre is right down my alley. Sure, the sets are cheap, but they really did decent with what they had. brbr"
21217,One of the few 9/11 movies that will live long in the memory.........
21218,"""Does God's light guide us or blind us?"" (In various languages with English subtitles) Grade: 8/10 (B+) (Seen on 10/31/04)"
21219,Not surprising that this film is at best neutral in its stance towards America. Probably the most 'anti' segment comes from Ken Loach who is definitely not towing the British New Labour party line.
21220,"A collection of eleven short stories about the tragedy of the September 11th 2001 in the United States of America, based on the tragic event of the September 11th 2001 in the United States of America."

21224,One of the best efforts you will see in any Film. This film tries to touch every possible core of WTC. Here are some of the most important stories from the film that makes this film so unique.
21225,One of the best anti-war documentaries I've seen in a long time........
21226,This film truly opened my eyes to what people outside of the United States thought about the September 11th attacks. This film was expertly put together and presents this disaster as more than an attack on U.S. soil.
21227,I've got to give it to the people that got this thing together. 9/11 is such a sensitive issue that making a movie that dares to be controversial about it takes a great deal of guts.
21228,"A very powerful and varied collection of documentaries from artists all over the world.<n>A very controversial film, especially for conservative Americans. I think two segments might really tick off the right.<n>Some segments were excellent and covered issues that"

21232,One of the best films I've seen in a long time. I can't remember the last time I saw it. I'm glad I did.
21233,"A very interesting project which could have been quite brilliant. Unfortunately, not all 11 parts are made as well. Youssef Chahine, in his segment ""Egypt"", assumes the Arab stance of the self-inflicted collective guilt, which..."
21234,"This is the greatest film I saw in 2002, whereas I'm used to mainstream movies. It is rich and makes a beautiful artistic act from these 11 short films."
21235,Why some people find this movie so anti-american? I don't understand why some people find this movie so anti-american. This film puts very clearly - differently of what some people think - that everything we do today will determine our
21236,"the movie is great, like every other international project that includes strong impressions. three of them (israel, bosnia and egypt) should've been cut out."
21237,"I'm not going to praise Iarritu's short film, even I'm Mexican and proud of his success in mainstream Hollywood.brbrWhat i'm talking about is that most of the short films does"
21238,A great idea. 11 stories about 11 September. 11 directors from different countries with different results. A great idea. 11 stories about 11 September. 11 directors from different countries with different results. A great idea.
21239,"An anti-American film, but not pro-American either. The eleven pieces adopt varied attitudes and the common link is that the disaster of the WTC attack has to be seen in perspective from different view-points."

21243,"Shaolin Temple is an enjoyable low-budget kung fu film. Not up to the quality of a good Jet Li film, but definitely worth a look for fans of the genre."
21244,"This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. If you know the Real World and the people from those shows, this movie will be top notch"
21245,"Hilarious film. I saw this film at the 2002 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Film Festival, and laughed from start to finish. The acting was subtle but very funny."
21246,"If you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie. If you are young or old then you will love this movie, hell even my mom liked it."
21247,One of the best Errol Flynn films ever made. I'm waiting for it on DVD.......
21248,"Errol Flynn's best performance in a long time, and it's not just because he's an actor...it's because he's an actor!"
21249,"""The Roar of the Crowd"" is a lively and well-remembered fictionalized biography. James J. Corbett's autobiography ""The Roar of the Crowd"" was the starting point of this lively and well-remembered fictionalized biography"
21250,"""The Play is the Most Important Thing"", or something like that, may well have been our own, super-veteran film Director, Mr. Raoul Walsh. If it wasn't old Will, it may well have been our own"

21253,"A wonderful film about the rise of the pugilistic pugilistic prancer, and the wind of change as regards the sport of boxing circa the 1890s."
21254,"""I can lick any man in the world in the world of course...romanticism again"" hands over his belt to Corbett.? No. But wonderful. Hey, if you want realism watch ""Raging Bull"" instead."
21255,One of the greatest sports movies ever made by Hollywood. What a wonderful story about one of the great sports figures of American history. James J. Corbett especially interesting is that Mr. Corbett introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day.
21256,"Good, but not the definitive biography of the boxer James ""Gentleman Jim"" Corbett--if you're looking for a 1940s ""Hollywood-ization"" of his life"
21257,"Not James J. Corbett's story, but Errol Flynn's is the best portrayal of his life. But Corbett had he been alive in 1942 no doubt would have loved the movie and loved Flynn's portrayal of his life."
21258,Errol Flynn's greatest movie. Not just a sports movie with a wonder last 5 minutes where Ward Bond shines. Don't miss it just because you think its an old movie. Its a classic that could be easily missed.
21259,One more thing about Gentleman Jim. I agree with all the assessments that make this among Errol Flynn's greatest outings in a career of great outings. I would think this role playing boxer Jim Corbett is more like his real personality than the 
21260,"Excellent Warner Bros effort starring Errol Flynn in one of his best screen performances. It's often cited as his best, and I can't really judge fully until I have seen his ""Dawn Patrol"""
21261,"Errol Flynn at his ""Best"" in ""Gentleman Jim""<n>Flynn at his ""Best"" in ""The Roar of the Crowd"" in ""Comstock Bank"""
21262,"Errol Flynn is ""Gentleman Jim"" in this 1942 film about boxer Jim Corbett.<n>Good film to catch Flynn at the height of his too-short time as a superstar."
21263,"Raoul Walsh's ""Gentleman Jim"" still holds up real well today.brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr"
21264,One of Flynn and Ward's Best Performances in a Long Career brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
21265,"I meant that in a GOOD way, believe me. True to life, it ain't. The whole Oirish thing gets kinda thick, but you DO enjoy the cast here-Flynn, Smith, Bond, Watson, Watson"
21266,"Errol Flynn at his best as he's never been before in a boxing movie - and he's still at his best in this one, too."
21267,"Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale give great performances, and the plot of this film wraps itself up unconventionally, and raises some nice moral discussion questions."
21268,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time! I've loved this movie since I first saw it! I'll never forget it!
21269,"A great movie, but too short to be a real emotional roller-coaster. I'm a sucker for hot girls in need, but this movie just screamed for more footage of these girls in their depressing surroundings."

21285,"Not as dark as I thought it would be, but still worth seeing for Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale's good performances and a great soundtrack."
21286,"I loved the movie, but there were some bits that weren't developed enough. I thought personally that the girls were very vapid before they landed in prison..."

21291,A low budget film with a cast of unknowns and a minimum of on location shoots. The Philippines substitute for Thailand and nobody actually goes to Hong Kong.
21292,A good film with strong performances (especially the two leads). A 7 out of 10. A good film with Newton Thomas Sigel's beautiful photography.
21293,One of the best movies I've ever seen...and it's not just because it's a kid's movie...it's because it has real heart!

21362,"This is a quite grim picture of an old age, ostensibly self-dependent but hopelessly void and lonely inside. The directer composes the images more to convey passing sensations of anxiety and desire than any explicit meanings."

21523,"Five years on from the Tenko survivors returning home, and from Marion's double-edged ""Well that's that"".brbrIt's now 1950: reunion time. The gang's all here"
21524,"A very gritty, gutsy portrayal of a part of world war 2 history, that most of us in the U.S. had/have no idea ever occurred"
21525,"Tenko is the best British television show ever, and this movie picks up the threads nicely in its final season. But I do advise watching the series first, as the first 2 seasons are even better than this fantastic movie."
21526,Tenko is one of the best series I have ever seen on the BBC.The whole cast were very convincing in the parts they portrayed and although the 3rd series was somewhat slower it was compelling viewing and my evenings wont be the same without
21527,"The Theory Of Flight is an engaging character study of an artist (Branagh) yearning to break free of boredom and mediocrity, and a terminally ill patient (Bonham-Carter) in the last stages of ASL"
21528,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long, long time."
21529,"Branagh and Bonham-Carter are the stars of this film... and it's a fine piece of work. 8 out of 10, but Branagh and HBC get 10 out of 10."
21530,One of the best films I've seen in a long time. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
21531,"Loved this film. Real people, great acting, humour, unpredictable. The characters were believable and you really connected with them. If you're looking for a film about slightly offbeat characters outside the mainstream of society and how they help each other"
21532,One of the greatest women's films of the 1990's : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : :

21535,"Peter Greengrass' ""The Theory of Flight"" is one of his best films, but not as good as ""American Gigolo""<n>Helena Bonham Carter steals the show as Jane Harchard"
21536,"A great movie with a great performance by Helena Bonham Carter. I found it quite by accident, but am happy that I did. Kenneth Branagh's performance came close to stealing this movie from Helena Bonham Carter, but their strong chemistry together"
21537,"A bit quirky and bordering bad taste; but intelligent enough to be worthy of watching. I found this flick ambitious and humorous. Even in this role, Carter has a certain charisma and likability."
21538,One of my all-time favorites......not easy to find but worth the hunt.........I guarantee you will watch it more than once!.........I guarantee you will watch it more than once!
21539,"I'm a fan of Branagh, even more his Shakespeare' films, and, in the beginning, I saw it only for this... and I finished with tears in my eyes"
21540,"This is the best movie I've seen since White and the best romantic comedy I've seen since The Hairdresser's Husband. An emotive, beautiful masterwork from Kenneth Branagh and Helena Bonham Carter"
21541,Helena Bonham Carter is the center of this movie. She plays her role almost immobile in a wheelchair but still brings across her traditional intensity. Kenneth Branagh was tolerable.
21542,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it a few times, but never as much as this one."
21543,"Not a tear-jerker, but it's still a good movie........."
21544,A beautiful and funny movie that I would recommend to anyone. don't let the subject matter put you off. don't let the subject matter put you off.

21551,"A documentary about two rock bands, spanning a number of years. What makes it special is the examination of the complex contrasting personalities and the ironies of success and failure."
21552,"DiG! is a great film, even if you don't know anything about either band. It's more about the themes of rock music and how they develop that makes this film so interesting."
21553,The Dandy Warhols and the Brian Jonestown Massacre. What it actually turns out to be is a portrait of a borderline psychopath - Anton Newcomb - and his tortured relationship with the rest of the world.
21554,"Rock n' Roll is a messy business and DiG! demonstrates this masterfully. A project of serious ambition, and perhaps foolhardiness, the filmmaker is able to mend together seven tumultuous years of following around two unwieldy rock groups"
21555,A really cool flick. A must for any music snob. You don't really have to know about the bands to enjoy the movie. brbrThe movie centers around the Brian Jonestown Massacre.
21556,A must see if you are a music fan or documentary fan. A must see if you are a music fan or documentary fan. A must see if you are a music fan or documentary fan. A must see if you are a music fan
21557,"""You can't forget that Anton has been able to do the only thing he ever said he wanted to do. Make a lot of great music."""
21558,One of the best music documentaries I've seen in a long time. brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
21559,One of the best films about rock's subculture...........
21560,"One of the best documentaries I've seen in a long time, and one of the best documentaries I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time."
21561,Anton Newcombe is a real talent. He thinks he is god but is so prollific and interesting. The DW are not really that interesting in comparison musicly or otherwise.
21562,DiG! is not what it claims to be. The music industry is not what it claims to be. The music industry is not what it claims to be.
21563,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I love Brian Jonestown Massacre and this is what the BJM sound like (The Dandys are alright)
21564,One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen too many scenes that I don't know how they came about.
21565,"One of the best music/film films I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more than once, and I've seen it more than once."
21566,"One of the best documentaries I've seen in a long time, but it's not quite as good as Metallica's. Depends on who you ask. Depends on who you ask. Depends on."
21567,"Not just about one page of a band's history, but rather covers long period of the band's history. The uniqueness of this film, compared to other modern rockumentaries, is that it's not just about one page"
21568,"I loved this film, at first the slick graphics seemed odd with the grainy footage but I quickly got into it. There must have been thousands of hours of footage shot and I really admire the work done in cutting it down"
21569,One of the best examples of propaganda swastika swastika swastika swastika swastika swastika swastika swastika swastika swastika 
21570,A must-see for movie fans of the 1940s period! Doris Day is the star of the show! A must-see for Doris Day fans!
21571,"Starlift is a pleasant and interesting throwback to those all star musical pictures that every studio was putting out during the World War II years. When you've got such stars as Gary Cooper, James Cagney, Doris Day, Gordon Mac"
21572,"An absolutely brilliant film! Jiri Trnka, the master of puppet animation, confronts totalitarianism in this, his final, film. It would be banned by the Communist Czechoslovakian government (at the time)"
21573,"Ji Trnka's last animated short is an indictment of totalitarism. The elements are simple, the symbolisms simple, and his trademark ornaments almost absent here."
21574,"Trnka's ""Night Angel"" is one of the most haunting films I've ever seen, and I've seen it more than once."
21575,"Jir Trnka's Ruka is one of the finest, most technically-impressive animated movies I've ever seen. His Ruka is one of the finest, most technically-impressive animated movies I've ever seen."
21576,RUKA is a work of art--and a political statement--made during the Soviet-domination era of the Czech Republic in the 60's and 70's.
21577,I remember the moment when Jimmy Stewart embraced Kim Novak on the top of the Flatiron building and flung his hat away while the camera followed it to fluttering the ground.
21578,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time; with a great cast.. and beautiful cinematography.. and a great story..
21579,One of Jimmy Stewart's best films..and one of his best actresses..and one of his best actors..and one of his best actresses..
21580,"A charming film, good for a Sunday afternoon, good around Christmas (as part of it takes place at Christmastime), and great if you feel like smiling"
21581,"This is a wonderful film, makes the 1950's look beautifully stylish. Kim Novak is intriguing and compelling as a modern-day witch with one foot in Manhattan and another in infinity"
21582,"Bewitching, but not quite as good as ""Vertigo""<n>Janice Rule plays Kim Novak's rival, but it's not quite ""Vertigo"""
21583,"A great companion piece to ""Vertigo"" with it's happy ending.<n>The cast is terrific. Lemmon hilarious as Novak's warlock brother and Elsa Lancaster giving a classic performance as the Aunt."
21584,"Miss Novak steals the show in this romantic fantasy about a modern-day witch who beguiles a successful Manhattan publisher. James Stewart may get top billing, but it is Kim Novak who steals the show as one of the most alluring witches ever"
21585,"""Love is the strongest Magick of all, and never to use it in a controlling or vengeful way. That's a lesson everyone needs to learn"""
21586,"Bell, Book and Candle is one of the great pop culture phenomena of the mid-twentieth century. It made Novak a huge star, put a nice item on Jack Lemon's resume, cast new light on Jimmy Stewart,"
21587,one of the few films I've fallen in love with as a child and gone back to without......
21588,What does the Marquis de Sade have to do with Egyptian archaeology and mermaid worshipping cults? Tobe Hooper tries to answer that question in one weird little film
21589,"""Things that make life worthwhile"" is not the kind of film that we find to bend every corner, but it is not sufficiently different or special as we want to do."
21590,"Gmez Pereira finally matures and makes a good movie, and he's the best actor of his generation (by far) in ""Cosas Que Hacen..."""
21591,This movie is a little spoon of hope in these days. And the main lesson for me.. is that at the end of the day...the love is main force behind us.
21592,Fred Olen Ray does a great job directing this B western. William Smith and Randy Travis are the best actors in the film. Randy Travis is the best Lee Van Cleef impression.
21593,"One of the best westerns I've seen in a long time,I'm an older male and love westerns,I'm a Randy Travis fan"
21594,"One of Dudikoff's better westerns, but hits a few low points in the shape of a naff central...."
21595,One of Dudikoff's better films...........
21596,"Hare Rama Hare Krishna was the biggest hit movie of 1971. Filmed almost entirely in Kathmandu, the movie depicts not only with the theme of a broken family, but also a relationship between a brother and a sister, as well as drugs and"
21597,This movie is about the love of the two siblings who are separated in childhood and revival of the same feeling when they meet years later. It is also the quest of the subdued brother to reunite with his sister who has chosen to be wild to
21598,I love the R.D. Burman music and in spite of the cruder elements of the story I found much to be moved by as I kept re-watching the movie
21599,The story for Hare Rama Hare Krishna actually came to Dev Anand's mind when he saw hippies and their fallen values in Kathmandu where he was on a visit after the protests against his previous Prem Pujari in Calcutta
21600,A must see to experience hippie culture and beautiful Nepal of 70's. Devji who does believe in making different movies has been successful in showing what he wanted to show here.

21603,One of the best games i've seen in a long time! I'm a big Max Payne fan and this is my favorite game of all time!
21604,Dead To Rights is one of the best video games I've ever seen.It's fun for the whole family.It's a hard game.
21605,"It's not a masterpiece, but it's still a good movie. It's not the worst movie I've seen in a long time."
21606,"This is actually a groovy-neat little flick, made on absolutely no discernible budget with shot on video crinkliness. It takes a little while to warm up to it. The acting is so bad that it soon acquires a zen-"
21607,Kimi wa petto is a cute story about a girl who one day finds a boy inside a box that is outside her apartment one day. She decides to bring him in and fix his cuts. She then leaves a note for him to

21616,"One of the best Sopranos episodes, but it's not as good as the season premiere. It's a bit over-the-top."
21617,A solid thriller about a troubled photographer and his model victims.<n>Michael Callan's fine acting helps keep the story moving at a steady pace.
21618,One of the finest horror films of the 1980s. Callan's best performance in a long time. One of the best slasher films of all time.
21619,One of the best versions of the novel I've ever seen - and it's not just because it stars Timothy Dalton. It's because it stars Zelah Clarke!

21621,One of the best adaptations of Jane Eyre I've ever seen...and it's great to see the whole miniseries in its entirety after all these years!
21622,"The best version of Jane Eyre I've ever seen on film. I've seen it more than once. I've read the book, and I'm amazed at how closely it followed Charolette Bronte's writing."
21623,"The best ""Jane Eyre"" adaptation I've ever seen -- and it's not just because it's the best adaptation of any novel I've seen. It's the best adaptation of any novel I've seen."
21624,"This is the best version of Jane Eyre that you will see. Dalton is a little tough to imagine as Rochester who Jane Eyre declared ""not handsome."" But his acting overcomes this and Zelah Clark is also a complete and believable Jane Eyre"
21625,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time! I've seen it over and over again, and it's still the best!"

21636,"Much better than either of the 2 1990's versions, but not all that good. There is definitely scope for a TV adaptation of this length that has more than a tenner spent on it."

21638,"The best adaptation of Jane Eyre I have ever seen. Timothy Dalton is the best Rochester I have seen on screen brooding and tragic. Zelah Clarke is the perfect combination of strength,courage,shyness and gentleness as Jane."
21639,"One of the best ""Jane Eyre"" productions I have ever seen! Timothy Dalton as Rochester is absolutely perfect! I am a bit of a ""Jane Eyre"" purist as it is my favourite book and have never seen another production that is faithful"
21640,"The most perfect adaptation of the best romance novel ever. brbrI'd forgotten how much I loved this movie until I got out my old VHS copy recently. Timothy Dalton is very handsome, but still perfect as Rochester."
21641,"Jane Eyre is a favorite for many reasons, mainly because there isn't a part of the book I liked less, only parts I enjoyed more. The 1983 TV mini-series with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton was everything I hoped it"
21642,One of the best Jane Eyres I've ever seen. brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
21643,"I liked this version, although the shot on video aspect was sometimes distracting, and the scenes with Jane and St. John never quite gelled. I give this an 8"
21644,"It's the right length to do the story full justice, and makes considerable use of Bronte's cracking dialogue. It's a pleasure to hear Bronte's remarkable dialogue spoken by such accomplished actors."
21645,"""Jane Eyre"" is one of my favorite books of all time and it is still my favorite ""Jane Eyre"" film. Timothy Dalton as Mr. Rochester and Zelah Clarke as Jane Eyre"
21646,This is the best Jane Eyre movie I've ever seen! Timothy Dalton is amazing as Rochester. I was glad that they cast a normal looking actress (Zelah Clark) as Jane and not a glamorous person.
21647,"This movie had to be fun to make, for us it was fun to watch it. The actors look like they have a fun time. My girlfriends like the boy actors and my boyfriends like the girl actors."
21648,"Who ever came up with story is one sick person. I rented it for our slumber party sleepover and all six of us got freaked out cause we're all in an acting class together, and we know a couple of the actors from..."
21649,Very good except for the ending which was a huge disappointment. brbrThe script was very good as was the acting. brbrThe visuals were often very grainy but this in a way added to the film as
21650,I finally got around to seeing this after hearing great things about it. It actually exceeded my expectations. Considering the budget involved this was a surprisingly competent and well-made film
21651,One of the most 'twisted' movies with respect to cold-hearted violence - but the ending occluded this film from higher acclaim. I would have given it a 9 if it was in keeping with the rest of the film.
21652,"Savage Island's raw savagery will scare the hell out of you! Trust me, this is a real horror film with some truly wonderful horror moments!"
21653,A visual challenge to all those who put their eye behind the lens. This little jewel is an amazing account of what you can shoot in just 16 days. Good going folks!
21654,Richard Thomas at his best being bad! This is a must see for any Richard Thomas fan! Bruce Davison is a nice guy... but the real talent here is Thomas!

21663,I love this movie!!! Purple Rain came out the year I was born and it has had my heart since I can remember. Prince is so tight in this movie.
21664,"The soundtrack is a true classic. It's a great party song and very up-tempo, Take Me With U(a fun pop song...), The Beautiful Ones(a cheerful ballad, probably the closest thing to R&B"
21665,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Prince is the real star of this movie.. he's just the best.
21666,This is the only movie I've seen Prince in but it don't matter. And I thought he was only great at singing boy was I wrong. This is probably his best performance.
21667,"Not as bad a movie as some reviewers say it is, and as the summary at the IMDB page for this movie, say it is. As the sum of its parts, not a bad movie at all"
21668,"Excellent movie, has it all, great music(Prince of coarse!), romance, and drama.brbrThis is really a very sad movie, very moving."
21669,"""Purple Rain"" deserves to be a cult classic - and deserves to be. If you are a Prince fan this is for you.brbrThe main plot is Prince seeing his abusive parents in himself and him falling in love with"
21670,One of the best movies i've seen in a long time! I cant believe i didn't buy a t-shirt of it!
21671,One of the Best Movie Musicals of All Time. I'm still No. 1 with Prince. He's still No. 1 with me.
21672,Prince's first film and greatest. The follow-up sucked. But I haven't seen for years so here's what I can remember about it
21673,One of the best movies I've ever seen in my life. I think it's a great movie to watch and own. Above what anyone else says I think it's a great movie to watch and own.

21678,This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time........
21679,"""The best rock movie ever made...period"" - Quentin Tarrinno, ""The best rock movie ever made...period"" - Morris Prince, Jerome Benton"

21681,Purple Rain is a great film if you are a 40-something music lover who partied to Prince music in the 1980s. The story is a much-used formula: Rising musical talent must overcome...
21682,SPOILERS CONTAINED IN ORDER TO MAKE A OBSERVATION. SPOILERS CONTAINED IN ORDER TO MAKE A OBSERVATION....
21683,"The Idea, is definitely a film to be experienced and not just viewed as it taps into one's internal voice / conscience through the looking, it makes one feel as opposed to just watch"
21684,Interesting way of looking at how we as humans so often behave we are sometimes blinded by our desire to achieve perfection that we some times destroy the foundation of what we are trying to achieve
21685,One of the best films I've seen in a long time. I've seen it with a special screening of the work of Owen Alik Shahadah.

21687,"I am a blessing and with the blessing the emotion is followed by shame. I first say this film as part of a ""black"" film festival. But then i asked myself what next? Where can someone else see this work?"
21688,One of the best short films I have ever seen. A must see for anyone who wants to make a change in their life. A must see for anyone who wants to make a change in their life.
21689,The Idea offers a multidimensional look at a community assigned to hoods and dealers. But the funny thing is this is not at all the focus or even the subject of the short.
21690,"First Portuguese film I have seen in my life, and I enjoyed it. The plot is related to how the young army officers took the power in Portugal in 1974, to finally defeat the fascist government of Caetano and to also finalize the wars"

21698,"Women have never looked so attractive and pathetic as in Salazar's film Piedras. Although editor's cut here and there might help the film, it is exciting and enjoyable with an intense mark from Pedro Almodovar's latest films"

21770,"John Wayne as a U.S. envoy to Japan in the late 1850s. A nice example of ""diplomacy"" in a film that takes a lot of liberties with the truth."
21771,"A surprisingly light-handed touch at a 1950's culture-clash movie. John Wayne would hardly be one's first choice as a cultural attache, being about as diplomatic with his good intentions as a bull-run in Harrods"

21880,"Deliverance is a good horror/thriller, but it's not quite as good as I thought it would be. I did like it, but for fans of gore, there isn't really much of it."
21881,This is one of the most disturbing and amazing films of all time and it has clearly had much influence on films today and probably will forever. I can't believe I thought this film was boring!
21882,"One of Burt Voight's best performances in a long time. Not the perfect date movie, but still a great movie. Not the sort of movie you could watch every week but it has a strong punch and is beautifully filmed."

21895,"The Man in the White Suit is an intelligent, thought-provoking and witty comedy with a moral. The comedy isn't always obvious, and it doesn't always work, but the film is not meant to be a film that provoke"

21923,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, but it's not the best movie I've seen in a long time."
21924,"Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh steal the show here. Cage and Boyle are fine, but what gives this neo-noir its juice is Hopper's creepy, violent character and JT Walsh's sneakiness"
21925,Nick Cage at his best in this movie- it's a must-see for all Cage fans......
21926,"One of Cage's best, if not his best, films.........."
21927,"Cage and Hopper meet and fortunately not in a Lynch moviebecause RED ROCK WEST is way better than any Lynch movie. Nicolas Cage is a thirdrate actor, the porcelain babe is a surrogate femme fatal, only daddy Hopper is as mean"

21929,One of the best westerns I've seen in a long time - and it's not just because it's John Dahl's film!
21930,"One of the best westerns I've seen in a long, long time...and I've seen it on video. I've never seen it on TV."
21931,"An excellent example of ""cowboy noir"", as it's been called, in which unemployed Michael (Nicolas Cage) loses out on a job because he insists on being honest (he's got a bum leg)"
21932,John Dahl's third movie in the noir style. Worth recommending. 7/10. Lara Flynn Boyle was hot and handled her part perfectly as the femme fatale. Dennis Hopper played his part well. But I feel he was miscast for

21936,"Good, but not as good as some of the other movies I've seen, but still worth a watch. Cage's acting makes this one worth it."
21937,"Like Dahl's The American Friend, this movie has a lot of plot twists and turns that seem improbable, but all lead to the cathartic self discovery."
21938,A surprise thriller with more twists and double crosses than a doodle pad. A great cast mixing it up with an intriguing plot overseen by a Twin Peaks-ish influence in director Dahl.
21939,This is a'sleeper'. It defines Nicholas Cage. The plot is intricate and totally absorbing. The ending will blow you away.brbrSee it whenever you have the opportunity.
21940,"One of Cage's Best Performances in a Low-Budget Film. One of my favorite movies of all time. ""Red Rock West"" was a low-budget, almost un-known film, but is one of my favorite movies"
21941,"A modern film noir with its off beat humour and dizzying succession of plot twists delivers a story full of surprises, dangerous characters and excellent entertainment from start to finish."
21942,A real treat for all of us longing for the past. The term 'neo-noir' has been so often used inappropriately in the last ten years that it has lost its meaning and...
21943,One of those rare films that keeps you guessing the entire time as to what will happen next. Nicolas Cage is mistaken for a contract killer as he enters a small town trying to find work. Dennis Hopper is the bad guy and no one plays
21944,"One of the best thrillers I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it's a Ludlum movie. It's because it's written by John Dahl."
21945,"One of Cage's best roles, but Boyle's not so good, but it's a good film noir thriller, and Cage is great!"

21954,Reign Over Me (titled after the who song) is a movie that is sure to bring a tear to almost everyone's eye. It was a moving story of a guy (sandler) that lost his family in the 9-11 world

21958,"""Reign Over Me"" is a good drama about loss, friendship, family and loneliness. The September 11th is irrelevant to the plot. But the family drama works, supported by the great performances of Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle."

21963,"A very fine film. If you have ever lost and felt alone, this film will assure you that you're not alone.brbr"
21964,"One of the most interesting things about this movie is its use of music as a motif. Would I face the problem head on, cope, and move on with my life or would I just put my headphones on and block the world?"
21965,Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle are the real stars of this film.<n>Reign over Me is one of the best movies i've seen in a long time
21966,"It's not the best movie of the year, but it's a very enjoyable, watchable, watchable movie, all in all. The movie takes it's name from the song ""Love Reign O'er Me"""

21985,A powerful film about identity and the sub-cultures that exist outside of the society we live in. I believe it give great insight into a sub-culture who shakes the very ideas that the viewer has of society.
21986,Wonderfully put together..I wish there was a follow up to this documentary to follow up with the lives of some and celebrate the lives of others lost...there should be a part two..a real one.

21990,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.........
21991,The art of still photography unfortunately does not automatically translate to cinematography. Soft focus becomes out-of-focus and discrete angles become confusing. You either see it or miss it and there's no time to observe.
21992,"A bit different from other Hamilton movies, but still good for Hamilton fans.<n>Not as good as other Hamilton movies, but still good for Hamilton fans."
21993,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time."
21994,"Finally a Category III movie for the summer 2006 season. Made of equal parts cruelty, crime and passion, Dog Bite Dog benefits not merely from an apt title, but also flexible direction, superb cinematography and respectable performances from most involved."
21995,One of the most nihilistic and brutal films I've ever seen. This is an action-melodrama like the world has never seen it before. Sometimes the plot got me close to tears. Chilling performance by Edison Chen

21999,Dog Bites Dog is a breath of fresh air in the Asian martial arts genre. It's one of the best films I've seen in a long time.
22000,"DOG BITE DOG is a solid film, but not quite the ""rebirth"" of the CATIII films that I've been looking forward to..."
22001,I was surprised by the depth of the characters and relationships in this film. It is truly a deeply moving and effecting film if you give it a chance. I suppose the biggest determining factor of whether or not one will get much out of Dog

22003,"One of the best Hong Kong action films of the 90s, but it's not a 'classic' slice of excess. It's still worth a watch."

22017,"Lock Up Your Daughters is one of the best high-spirited comedies I have ever seen. It is misunderstood since it lacks the ""social commentary"" values that many films of the day (1969) required to be successful."
22018,"I agree with the other comments. I saw this movie years ago. Christopher Plummer is hilarious as a dandy. The ribaldry is unsurpassed. If this comes out on video, I will definitely buy it"
22019,"A real classic. A shipload of sailors trying to get to the towns daughters while their fathers go to extremes to deter the sailors attempts. A maidens cry for aid results in the dispatch of the ""Rape Squad"""
22020,I was surprised with the quality of the movie. It was far better than I expected. Scenario and acting is quite good. The director made a good job as well.
22021,"""Gen"" does not add any difference to horror movies, but it does not disappoint thriller fans. In this respect it is a success for Yesilcam and Turkey"

22027,"Meatball Machine is an amazing splatter film, it has an original plot with young love, buckets of blood, and weird alien creatures that mutate people into freakish robotic war machines"
22028,MEATBALL MACHINE is one of the best Japanese cyber-punk films I've ever seen - but it's not your typical TETSUO-meets-GWAR
22029,"This is one sweet ride! Don't be fooled by the silly title folks, this is one sweet ride! A true successor to Tetsuo the Iron Man and Ichi the Killer, this gem starts with a bang and lays the go"

22039,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time - and I've seen it more than once. It's a must-see.
22040,"One of the most beautifully photographed and designed movies I have ever seen. Veteran cameraman Conrad Hall will very likely win another Oscar for his work here.<n>If a Rolls-Royce was a movie, I've no doubt it would"
22041,One of the best-looking crime films you'll ever see. Conrad Hall went out with a bang. He did himself proud as this is one of the best-looking crime films you'll ever see.
22042,"One of the best gangster movies of all time, but it's not the best, but it's one of the best. Sam Mendes' best."
22043,"""There are only murderers in this room, murderers.., and there's only one guarantee, none of us will see Heaven."" - Tom Hanks"
22044,The best mob film ever made. It deserved more then what it got at the Oscars. I'm surprised i don't see him in more movies today.
22045,"One of the greatest movies of all time. I could not have been more pleased. The Road to Perdition, directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty), is destined to become one of the greatest movies of all time."
22046,A haunting and beautiful film.............
22047,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time - and it's not just about gangsters. It's about the relationship between a father and son thrown together in the most tragic of circumstances."
22048,"I loved this film! I'm a true Tom Hanks fan, and I have always been impressed with all of his work. But in this film Hanks isn't the only great actor who lights up the screen."
22049,"Tom Hanks at his best as a hit-man in a 1930's depression era film. So sit back, and enjoy the wild ride. So sit back, and enjoy the wild ride."

22051,"Tom Hanks is at his finest in this film. This is by far, Tom Hanks at his finest. He comes off as a bit gritty, but still emerges smelling like a rose, even until the very last scene, the assassination of his"
22052,"Road to Perdition is a sleeper film that should be watched for years to come. This movie is a great story that takes you on a ride through the Midwest and into the legend of Mike Sullivan: husband, hit-man, and devoted"
22053,An excellent depiction of one of the more unwholesome aspects of that era. I loved the visuals--very fitting for a story connected to a graphic novel.
22054,An excellent film!Tom Hanks and Paul Newman performed great!I was really surprised when Newman was beating on his son!That was a great scene and the shooting scenes were staged good. I was very surprised about the end.
22055,"Tom Hanks is excellent in a very memorable movie. Make room for some Oscars! Filmed beautifully catching the drama of life in the 30's. Sometimes the pace bogs down, but then a burst of graphic violence sustains the story."
22056,"One of my favorite movies, with a very nostalgic ending. The movie is about the Sullivan family, obviously Michael Sullivan (the father) is one of the main members of the mafia, the killer to say it this way, and an expert"

22059,"This is a film that can make you want to see it again. I especially, liked the way it ended. I did not see the end coming, but when Laws was not blown away the first time, one suspects he will be back"
22060,"A bloody gangster story which takes place in the years of Great Depression. It tells us about another notorious hit-man, Michael (Mike) Salliwan. Somehow, this time the story turns the other way round."
22061,"""Road to Perdition"" is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
22062,Tom Hanks and Jude Law are the perfect team in this movie. It's a must see for anyone who loves the 1930's era of crime.

22066,"This is a truly magnificent and heartwrenching film!!!! Ripstein's locations are spectacular, extremely detailed and well lit, the dialogue is extraordinarily Garca Mrquez, no doubt about it"
22067,"El Coronel No Tiene Quien le Escriba, is a wonderful movie, that retells the classic story by Gabriel Garca Mrquez, by eliminating the magic realism elements, and replacing them with the crude reality lived"
22068,"a bit slow and boring, the tale of an old man and his wife living a delapidated building and interacting with a fixed cast of characters like the mailman..."
22069,"I liked this movie very much. Although this movie doesn't boast of big (or even known) names, its very charming. Its one of those feel good types where you know that everythings gonna be just fine in the end."
22070,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time! :) A must see for every child! :) A must see for every movie lover!
22071,Jennifer Mccomb is the star of this film. It was a neat film and you can watch it for the beauty of Africa and of course Mccomb. At that time I was thrilled watching this movie and from then onwards I am trying for

22073,"""Painting is seeing, then remembering better than you saw."" So says Dick Heldar (Ronald Colman), the painter in The Light That Failed.The movie is in the grand old Hollywood style, starring Ronald Colman and a bravura supporting cast"
22074,"Absolutely fantastic trash....this one has it all: nudity, good fight scenes, gore, action, explosions etc. It also stars the wonderful Belinda Mayne as Ingrid - not Olga as the other reviewer pointed out"
22075,What can you say about the film White Fire. Amazing? Fantastic? Disturbing? Hilarious? What can you say about the event which is White Fire.
22076,One of my all-time favorite 80's exploitation films! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
22077,Ginty's the best action hero I've ever seen... and he's the best actor I've seen in a long time.

22079,"Good for Ginty and Williamson, but not for the rest of the film. The co-ordination of the action sequences are laughable and make the film have some funny slap stick moments. Robert Ginty and Fred Williamson have a memorable scene together"
22080,"One of the best westerns of the 70's, even if it's not as famous as Parallax View, 3 Days of the Condor or JFK"
22081,"""I... comme Icare"" is one of the best movies of the 80s and 90s......"
22082,One of the best political thrillers I have ever seen in a movie. The ending sequence - explaining who Icarus really is - is the most powerful sequence I have ever seen in a movie.
22083,"A masterpiece from one of France's true geniuses. The plot is an exact parallel of the JFK assassination, and takes place in a non-descript, fictional country."
22084,"The best film I've seen in a long time, and I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once."
22085,"Finally a thriller which omits the car chases, explosions and other eye catching effects. The movie combines a simple plot (assasination of a french president) with an excellent background. It takes a look behind mans behavior with authorities"
22086,This is one of the best films I've ever seen - and I've seen it over and over again. I've seen it many times.
22087,this movie is very surprising and intelligent. I would like very much to watch it again because I think it's as surpring as the Sixth Sense althogh a completely different kind of movie

22089,"Two hours of entertainment on Saturday night. Henri Verneuil represented the commercial cinema in France from 1960-1980. He worked with the cream of the male actors of his day: Gabin, Belmondo, Fernandel, Delon, Sharif"

22099,"If you're anything like me, it's not easy to find someone you're in love with. DAN IN REAL LIFE is a must-see."
22100,A nice way to end an evening of sitting on the couch watching movies. Its not the be all and end all but it was a nice way to cap off an evening of sitting on the couch watching movies.
22101,"It was a nice surprise after all. its trailer did not predict a good film at all, it was even a bit misleading. Especially the part of Jeff Bridges was a positive surprise, well written, sardonic and funny. Less"
22102,"""How To Lose Friends & Alienate People"" is not based on Tiger Woods' infidelities. It is a mediocre romantic comedy based on Toby Young's book on his experiences working as a journalist covering..."

22104,"I really, really enjoyed watching this movie! At first, seeing its poster I thought it was just another easy romantic comedy... but it is simply more than this!"
22105,"Simon Pegg, Kirsten Dunst, Jeff Bridges, and Megan Fox make up the cast......."
22106,How to lose friends and alienate people is decent comedy with a bit of romantic approach. It's actually a story of Sidney Young(Simon Pegg) breaking through in journalist and magazine writing business which is interpreted in a funny way.
22107,'How To Lose Friends & Alienate People' is a superb film. A hilarious film from start to end. A lovely entertainer. Thumps Up!
22108,"It's a toss up, you'll either enjoy it to an extent or find it a little dull. I might add, Kirsten Dunst is adorable in this movie."
22109,"""How to Alienate Friends...."" is a nice celeb comedy with some less funny passages, a sweet cast but all too sudden ending. I'd say the movie isn't able to keep a high level. Besides I'd"
22110,"One of the best comedies I've seen this year along with Pineapple Express and Step Brothers. Its not one of those ""gross out"" comedies that heavily relies on fart jokes and toilet humor but instead moves at a pace and you will"
22111,"If you're in love, you'll love this movie, if you're in love you'll love this movie, if you're in love you'll love this movie, if you're in love you'"
22112,It's still cool. But it's still cool. The bike mechs are cool and the story works for the most part. There are some character issues that I hope work themselves out by part 2 and my biggest complaint of all
22113,"What do you get if you cross The Matrix with The Truman Show?brbrI'm sure you've all seen The Matrix by now. Just from watching the trailer to this classic, you can see where they took the"
22114,"""The League of Gentlemen"" is dark comedy at it's best..and it's not just about dressing in drag and lampooning the cultural ills..it goes deeper and much, much, much, darker.."
22115,The blackest comedy I've ever seen. I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it.
22116,"What's the difference between ""Little Britain"" and ""The League of Gentlemen""? It's not ""Little Britain"", it's ""The League of Gentlemen"""
22117,"What makes me proud to be British. This is by far the funniest thing on TV. The league consists of Jeremy, Steve pemberton, mark gatiss and the lovely Reece shearsmith. Totally underrated, this horror-comedy is"
22118,One of the best TV shows I've seen in a long time - and I've watched it a million times since I've seen it.
22119,Another example of the finest comedy in the world. The characters are superb and show unusual depth while retaining a scarily realistic edge. The look and feel of the program is perfect and reflects the sometimes bleak feeling of the North.
22120,The League of Gentlemen is one of the best comedies I've ever seen. It's one of the best comedies I've ever seen. It's one of the best comedies I've ever seen.

22123,It's been ten years since this show first aired on TV and delighted viewers with its unique mixture of comedy and horror. This is the show that gave birth to a good part of modern British humor: Dr. Terrible's House of
22124,"One of the best comedy series to ever come out of Britain. Mark Gatiss,Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton are terrific actors and performers who seem at home with drama as they are with comedy."
22125,"A weird, but wonderful place. The characters would be just wrong and too disturbing but the fantastically brilliant writing means that it works, and it works very well."
22126,The League of Gentlemen remains one of the greatest modern comedies of recent times. A fantastic show and an unrealized classic. The third series is both a refreshing change of pace of style and a real treat for fans who've already seen the first
22127,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and I'm sure I've seen it many times before. I'm sure I've seen it many times."

22129,Parrots are not disposable pets...they are a gift to be treasured.........
22130,"A really heart-warming family movie. It has absolutely brilliant animal training and ""acting"" (if you can call it like that) as well (just think about the dog in ""How the Grinch stole Christmas""... it was plain bad training"
22131,"A real pleasure to watch. Adults and children could watch it together - how unusual! My aunt liked it, too. It had laughter, tears, love, adventure, special effects, good actors - and a talking parrot"
22132,"""Paulie"" is more than just a kid's movie. It's a very well done movie. I certainly recommend it. Also starring Jay Mohr, Buddy Hackett, Bruce Davison, Hallie Eisenberg and Trini Alvarado."
22133,"I was surprised to find that the voice of Paulie was performed by Jay Mohr. The performance was so finely nuanced, neither wavering into schmaltz nor becoming too hard under the New Jersey swagger, that I thought that this must be some"
22134,"I was very surprised with this film. I was touched with the lives that paulie touched along his way to find his ""marie"" the little girl he was separated from."
22135,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time. I've seen it many times, and I've watched it over and over again."
22136,The Best None-animated Family Film I've Seen in Quite a while. Back to the first Homeward Bound. Paulie is a humerous movie about life through a parrot's POV.
22137,"Paulie is the best family movie I have found and wholeheartedly enjoyed. Ever. Seriously. Pick up a copy and sit back and enjoy a true family movie, with the whole family. No sleeping. No sleeping."
22138,Paulie is a wonderful film filled with touching moments.The characters are all lovable especially Paulie as he enters the lives of many people on his journey.It is journey worth experiencing. Don't miss it!
22139,One of the best animated films I've seen in a long time.........
22140,"Paulie's story is a moving, sad, happy and interesting one - from the moment he is first seen to the moment he is united with his original owner"
22141,A sentimental story with a sentimental sound track. It's about a little girl ( with a voice impediment ) who treasures her green parrot Paulie.
22142,"A very refreshing story, the life of a parrot with an intellect higher than an average human's. Shows humans from a bird's point of view. Especially liked the portrayal of different types of characters that the bird spends time with."
22143,"""Paulie"" really touched me deeply. This is, after the ""Ugly Duckling"", the second picture that really turned me upside down."
22144,This is a great film about a conure. He goes through quite the ordeal trying to get back to his little girl owner. He learns a lot through his journey and meets up with a lot of other beautiful birds.
22145,The Best Movie I've Seen In A Long Time! It's So Sweet and Heartwarming! It'll Touch Your Heart! It'll touch your heart!
22146,"Add Paulie the parrot to beloved movie animal characters. This movie is a love story - bird and Gena Rowlands, Bird and beloved Marie, Michael and Marie. A Russian janitor helps a talking and thinking parrot find his rightful owner many"
22147,"This is such a great movie to watch with young children. I'm always looking for an excuse to watch it over & over. Gena was good, Cheech was fun,the Russian was good, Maria was adorable & of course"
22148,This is a great movie. It surprises me sometimes how good a movie with no pretenses can be. This one is just fabulous. It could be that it isn't TRYING too hard to send any kind of message...
22149,"A charming movie featuring two strong characters who genuinely befriend the little parrot separated from his young owner. Bless Paulie in his new home, at last with Marie, perhaps joined by the nice young man who helped him defeat the antagonists to complete his"
22150,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it many times. I've watched it over and over again.
22151,"The movie was very sweet and heartwarming! I would recommend this movie for every one. The actors did a great job of acting, and the movie was very well played and done."
22152,"""Paulie"" is a great movie for kids and adults who are a kid at heart. It's a touching reunion. Otherwise,it's a great movie for older kids and adults who are a kid at heart."
22153,"""Paulie"" is a sleeper film you won't regret watching. It's so all-around wonderful, it's a shame it scores so poorly for the general IMDb voter."
22154,"Paulie sounds like the most saccharine, lachrymose and sentimental garbage you could ever find, yet it's actually much better than you might expect."
22155,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.. I've seen it many times.. I've seen it many times..
22156,Paulie is a fantasy of a littler girl or perhaps her recollection of what her youth was like growing up. Tony Shaloub executes a flawless performance as an Russian Scientist (PhD) who cannot find decent work in America.
22157,"One of the best movies I ever saw was an Irish movie titled Philadelphia,Here I Come. I read the play before I saw the movie and loved them both."
22158,Donal McCann and Eamonn Kelly put in a great performance as Public Gar and Private Gar in this adaptation of the classic play. Definitely worth renting out if you can find it. (Probably unavailable outside Ireland & UK)
22159,"This film IS IRELAND. In all it's grubiness, it's sadness,it's self-delusion.The Boys,Master Doyle, SP O'Donell, The Cannon, Senator Do"
22160,A beautiful reconstruction of small time Ireland in the 1970/s. All the gang are there see below. See this film. Feel Ireland as it was.

22162,One of the best concerts I have ever been to. Bette Midler at her absolute best.......
22163,"""Diva Las Vegas"" is one of Bette Midler's best performances to date. Her voice is as beautiful as ever and will truly impress you. The highlight of the show was her singing ""Stay With Me"" from her 1979"
22164,"Love it, love it, love it! This is another absolutely superb performance from the Divine Miss M. From the beginning to the end, this is one big treat! Don't rent it- buy it now!"
22165,One of the best live concerts I've ever seen. Bette Midler is the Divine Diva.......
22166,BETTE MIDLER: DIVA LAS VEGAS is one of the best live performances I've seen in a long time. She's one of the funniest people I've ever seen.
22167,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time - and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, too."
22168,"A beautifully observed portrait of the experiences of a young French homosexual. Eschewing both stereotypes and preaching, it's a wonderfully naturalistic film, superbly acted, shot with a feel for the seaside town where the action takes place."
22169,"""Come Undone"" has a way of staying with us even when it has ended. It is a character study about how a young man gets involved into a love affair with someone so much different than him that, in the end, will"
22170,Sébastien Lifshitz's 'Presque Rien' ('Come Undone') is an earlier work by the inordinately gifted writer/ director Sébastien Lifshitz
22171,"An adult, realistic, cruel, dark story, like a second part of ""les roseaux savages"" (the wild reeds), plenty of beauty and sadness, ellipsis and silences, shadows and little sparks of hope"
22172,"""Presque Rien"" is the best homo-themed movie I've ever seen.. and it's better than many of you have said.."
22173,One of the best French films of the past few years.<n>Stephane Rideau's performance is outstanding.<n>The film's final 45 minutes are so engrossing you won't be able to take your eyes off
22174,"One of the best films about first love I've seen in a long, long time......."
22175,"Not as good as I thought it would be, but it's still a good movie. It's not as bad as I thought it would be."
22176,"A very good French film, but not as good as I'd like it to be.........."
22177,"Sébastien Lifshitz, Stéphane Rideau and Jérémie Elkam are the best of the French. A movie witch, in my opinion, deserves an 8-9!"
22178,"One of the best 'flashbacks' I've seen in a long time, but it's not quite as good as it could have been!"
22179,"I liked this film very much. The story jumps back and forth quite a bit and is not easy to follow. There is no resolution to the story whatsoever, and you are left to wonder what really happened. ;-)"
22180,Deeply emotional. It can't leave you neutral.brbrYes it's a love story between 2 18 years old boys. But it's only the body of this movie. You...
22181,"There's a lot of emotion in this movie, but it's missing a lot of key points. The main reason to rent this movie is to enjoy some homoerotic vicarious thrills. But as a love story or character study it"
22182,The best part of this movie is the cinematography. It leaves you charmed with its beauty. I recommend this movie to all the people for whom the artistic side of films is very important and they will not be disappointed.
22183,one of the best foreign gay films i've seen in a long time...and i'm not just saying that because i've seen it in the U.S.
22184,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
22185,"The movie is very realistic. Absolutely, it does not belong to the Hollywood Cinema genre where every line must be pronounced in a perfect manner and where every move is precise."
22186,A romantic comedy with a heart-warming plot and a great performance by the lead actors.......
22187,A film that captures the experience of teenagers in a way that is comlex & sympathetic.......
22188,"A very close and sharp discription of the bubbling and dynamic emotional worldscription specialy one 18year old guy, that makes his first experiences in his gay love to..."
22189,"This movie was more of a passage into manhood for one gay man, and how he must deal with everyone. The ending was kind of a downer but the whole movie was entirely realistic and so I will let this real ending slip bye"
22190,One of the best movies i've seen in a long time.........
22191,"Disappointing, but worth seeing if you're a fan of Stephane Rideau and Jeremie Elkaim's acting.           "
22192,"Don't expect too much of it either. Don't hesitate to watch this movie, if it attracted your interest, but don't expect too much of it either."
22193,"An unusual Laurel & Hardy comedy with something of a split personality: at times it feels like two movies made in different styles spliced into a single short. Happily, each portion is funny in its own right."
22194,DIRTY WORK is a predictable L&H short on the surface with the boys going to sweep someones chimney.<n>But theres one or two things that seem untypical.
22195,"Laurel & Hardy in the role of chimney sweepers works out surprisingly hilarious. The movie is filled with some excellent timed and hilarious constructed sequences, which are all quite predictable but become hilarious to watch nevertheless thanks to the way they are all executed."
22196,Stan & Ollie sweep the chimneys at Professor Noodle's house. A very funny little film. Especially good is Stan & Ollie's contest of wills at opposite ends of the chimney. That's Lucien Littlefield as the Professor.
22197,Stan and Ollie at their funniest. Great fun.brbrRating: 5 stars out of 5.brbrDirty Work is Stan and Ollie at their funniest. Great fun.
22198,"A classic Laurel and Hardy comedy, with a little bit of a twist. I'm happy to see this one, and I'm happy to see any of their films."
22199,"One of Laurel and Hardy's better films, but not as good as HELP MATES, BUSY BODIES or...."
22200,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. I can't believe I've seen it so many times. I can't believe I've seen it so many times.

22202,"What happened to Bob, Camilla and the baby? It was left for the viewer to decide at the end of the film. Dean Cain was excellent in the role of Bob. Lexa Doig's character was confusing to understand."
22203,Rob Stewart is a wonderful actor I don't know why people keep giving him a bad rap. As for Mel Harris she is a great actress and for those who thinks she looks too old for Rob it's only by five years.

22218,"This was a pretty good movie, I liked it. I thought it was a pretty accurate look at bulimia and how it's not about dieting, it's about having a pain so deep that they have to find a way to deal"
22219,An excellent true story.I love Alison Lohman she is so talented side note: I also loved her in 7th heaven.The whole story line is amazing and the way they chose there characters waz awesome.
22220,"This is a film which should be seen by anybody interested in, effected by, or suffering from an eating disorder. It is an amazingly accurate and sensitive portrayal of bulimia in a teenage girl, its causes and its symptoms."
22221,The best movie I've ever seen about Bulimia. It hit the exact spot of what Bulimia is really about and how it's not always about being skinny and dieting.
22222,A grate film for anyone with an eating disorder or for people who know someone with an eating disorder or for people who know someone with an eating disorder or for people who know someone with an eating disorder
22223,"""Darius Goes West"" is the touching story of a brave teen coping with Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy and his personal quest to see the Pacific Ocean."
22224,"One word to someup this movie, WOW! I saw ""Darius Goes West"" at the Tribeca Film Festival. People in the theater were sobbing. This movie shows the hardships that Darius sufferes with Muscular Dystrophy."
22225,One of the best films I've seen in a long time - and I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once.
22226,"An amazing documentary about a teenager with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and his 11 friends who take him on a cross-country trip to see if ""Pimp My Ride"" will pimp out his wheelchair"
22227,"A touching story about an adventure taken by 15-year-old Darius Weems. Darius has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a still un-curable disease that took the life of his brother at age nineteen and is the number one killer"
22228,I've never seen a CG animated film that was as good as this one. Blue Sky Studios is a company to look out for in the future.
22229,"I can't stand it. My mom likes violent movies, so why did she see it? She rated it just to bring down the rating. So I know that's why it didn't have a higher rating."
22230,Scratch is the funniest character I've ever seen. He makes the movie all by himself. He's the reason I've just love this movie.
22231,"It's a nice movie, but it's rather in the ideal-world-and-fluffy-animals-for-children disney cliche"
22232,"One of the best animated movies I've seen in a long time, and it's not Disney's or Pixar's; it's more of an art work."
22233,"An interesting animation about the fate of a giant tiger, a sloth, and a mammoth, who saved a baby, who was close to be killed by a group of tigers during the ice age"
22234,"A great movie, but I think the great parts where already in the trailers, if you catch my drift. It went very fast and it rolled on, so I was never bored, and I enjoyed watching it."
22235,A must-see for your child's eyes...........
22236,"Not as good as Monsters Inc., but still fun to watch.. even if it's not quite as good as it could have been.."
22237,"It can be tear-jerking at times, so, kids, be warned. The real letdown is the animation. This wasn't so souped up like the toy story movies or shrek, and it shows."
22238,"A great movie, but I would rate ""Toy Story 2"" or ""Shrek"" higher than ""Sid the sloth"" or ""Diego"" above ""Sid the mountain lion"""
22239,"One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long, long time........."
22240,"Not a Disney film, but a nice animated film for the whole family to enjoy........"
22241,"One of the best animated films of the last decade, if you're a fan of the likes of 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Polar Express."
22242,I love cartoons. They can show things that films with'real' actors and scenery cannot - though computer effects are changing that more and more. They can push the boundaries of satire...

22244,I love the origami parts and the big 'twist' at the end. I absolutely love that scene when Michelle confronts Tony. It's actually one of my favorite scenes of Season 1

22246,"Not as good as Zombi 2, but still a good zombie flick. brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr"
22247,"It's not as creepy as ZOMBI 2 but it's a good one for the 80's. It's faster pace, better settings, and has sweet gore effects by Lucio Fulci."
22248,One of the most entertaining zombie films I have ever seen. Get some mates and some beer and you'll be in for a fun night. Did I mention the head in the fridge?!?!?
22249,"It's cheesy, but it's not that bad either. It has Beatrice Ring which is a huge bonus, and it's entertaining. I had the good fortune to meet Fulci later in his career and he remained philosophical about"
22250,"One of the best zombie movies I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it's a zombie movie. It's because it's entertaining."
22251,"A great Italian ""ZOMBIE"" movie by two great director's Luci Fulci (""ZOMBIE"") and Bruno Mattie (""HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD"")"
22252,Zombi 3............ Zombi 3.........
22253,"The best of the ""Zombi"" series, but it's not the best of the ""Nightmare City"" series...but it's the best of the ""Zombi"" series!"
22254,This movie is awesome on so many levels... and none of them are the level that it was intended to be awesome on.brbrJust remember this: When you're watching Shaun of the Dead and other recent zombie movies...
22255,"I liked this movie. It's a great zombie flick that is packed with action, original ideas, good acting, but is also packed with bad Zombie effects. Part IV, entitled ""After Death"" is also good. I would recommend"
22256,"A nice thriller with plenty of sex in it. I saw it on late night TV. There are two hardcore stars in it. Thankfully, Gabriella Hall has just a small part."
22257,What's the point of watching this movie if you're watching it for the sex? I want my soft-core and my hard-core separate
22258,"Great softcore sex, revealing and sexy, and plenty of it. Ignore the ignoramus who doesn't realize that raunchy IS sexy if done the right way"

22262,"It's not Dawson's Creek, it's a good film........."
22263,"This is a very good, made for TV film. It depicts trouble in suburbia circa 1970's and the sort of neighbors one certainly does not want to have around."
22264,"This is a great movie from the lost age of reactionary made-for-television drama. I give this film a 10, and I defy anyone to watch this film and not enjoy every minute."

22267,Outrage is pretty good movie! Robert Culp was very good in the movie and was perfect for the part! Its hard to believe that this is a true story but what can you do?

22269,One of the highlights of the 1st Season - and one of the best episodes of the 1st Season - of Star Trek: The Next Generation..
22270,The Holodeck set the stage for many interesting and unusual adventures to be had in the TNG world. This gem of a first season episode set the holodeck for many interesting and unusual adventures to be had there.
22271,"""The big goodbye"" introduces us to the first holodeck adventure, in this case Captain Picard posing as private investigator Dixon Hill. Star Trek never focuses on the story (mostly it's a simple ""how-do-we-get"

22274,One of Scott's better westerns..but it's not for the faint of heart......
22275,"One of the better Randoph Scott westerns of the late 60's, but not as good as ""The Last Picture Show"" of the 70's"
22276,"I remember this series so well. It was excellent... and so different to everything else on offer at the time... I am sure that it inspired the also excellent Canadian drama ""Traders"""
22277,Capital City should be on DVD. I fell in love with Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. I loved Rolf in this role and loved every other role that he has been in. I can't believe the show only lasted 13 episodes.
22278,'Capital City' fans rejoice! This first season of this series is now available from Network DVD and I've recently got my copy! Although very much an ensemble piece of key'maverick' trading floor characters 'CAPITAL
22279,"""Batman: The Mystery of the Batwoman"" is about as entertaining as an animated Batman movie gets. The animation is done with a lighter spirit than in the animated series."
22280,Not as good as the other Batman movies but still a good one.........
22281,The Mystery of Batwoman is a good movie but it's not as good as it could have been. I wish they could have made it longer.
22282,Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman is one of the best movies I've seen since Mask of Phantasm... and it's on DVD!
22283,A welcome addition to the video library.<n>Kevin Conroy once again delivers a voice over performance that is nothing short of excellence and perfection.<n>The musical score and especially the soft sounding intro were superb
22284,"An enjoyable Batman animated film. Not on par with ""Return of the Joker"" or ""Mask of the Phantasm"", but solid nonetheless. I liked how the movie kept you guessing..."
22285,"One of the last Bruce Timm/Paul Dini DTV projects related to their old 1992 Batman the Animated Series, but worth at least a rental."
22286,"It's not as good as the other Batman animated movies, but it's not as bad as some of the other ones either. But it doesn't give off the emotional appeal the other ones did."
22287,"Not quite as good as Mask of the Phantasm, but still a great animated Batman film. Kevin Conroy does a wonderful job as Bruce Wayne and Batman."
22288,"Not as good as the live action films, but it's still fun to see the new batgirl......"
22289,"One of the best Batman films of the last few years, but could have been a bit more complex......"
22290,"A good movie, but needs more Robin in it. I give it 7 out of 10 because the villains were interesting in their roles and the unknown batwoman creates an interesting ""guess who"" game."
22291,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time"
22292,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best foreign films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time."
22293,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, too."
22294,One of the best films I've seen in a long time. The story is fluidly woven into the present seamlessly. Casting was superb. Director Daniel Syrkin have done a superb job in getting the various actors to work together in this
22295,One of the best Australian films I've seen in a long time. I'm glad I saw it. I'm glad I saw it. I'm glad I saw it. I'm glad I saw it.
22296,Wonderfully acted story of a young girl's journey to discover where she has come from and where she is going. Hugo Weaving is brilliant as well.
22297,A complex story with the changing between eras. Also appreciated the underlying story of the unions losing power and the effect of a large employer closing on a small town.
22298,"I liked the light and the girls. The rest was without too much fault, but without too much merit either. I yearned for something like The Interview, or at least some matrix element here and there, but nothing out of the ordinary"
22299,"Is there no room anymore for what is simply a ""nice"" story? Is there no room for what is simply a ""nice"" film?"
22300,"""A small TV idea"" is beyond me. Besides I can think of many films that have ""a small TV idea"" in their plots. Besides I think it is among the best Australian films I have seen over the last couple of years"
22301,"One of the best films I have seen in a very long time. It deserves to win best picture at AFI's and IF's. Auscrit, please find something more constructive do with your time."
22302,"TEARS OF KALI is a strange, gory, sometimes downright creepy film which is somewhat constrained by it's obviously low budget - but is still an entertaining and worthwhile watch."
22303,One of the scariest flic i have seen. Be warned! This terrorizer has a big cast of good actors (as an example:Peter Martell as a European guru has a strong presence)
22304,Surprised by the twist and gory aftermath of each story. Very well written and well done. A must see for horror fans.....
22305,"Creepy &amp; Suspenseful, but not as good as some of the other ""cult"" films I've seen, I'd give it 8 out of 10"
22306,"one of the best low budget movies from Germany! is this is the dark side of new age? if you believe in esoteric, please don't watch this movie! it blows all your positive fantasies away."
22307,"One of the best independent horror films of the 00's, but not quite as gripping as some might have hoped. But still worth a look for adventurous horror fans."

22311,One of the greatest films of the 20th Century!! The greatest cinematic experience of all time!! Simply To DIE FOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
22312,Compelling and Innovative! Compelling and Innovative! This movie is about finding love in everybody's differences. It is about finding love and acceptance in a society that is dominated by greed and self-absorption.
22313,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time (and I've seen it over and over again since I was a kid)!
22314,"I enjoyed it. In general, I'm not a fan of comedies and comedians, but I do like Whoopi. I'm also partial to Sci/Fi Fantasy. And the dinosaur craze. And..."
22315,This is the best piece of film ever created Its a master piece that brought a tear to my eye. Ill never forget my experience watching it. I don't understand why people don't think as I do The dinosaur turns in

22317,Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy THE MOVIE is one of the best movies i've seen in a long time! I'll never forget it!
22318,"It's still a great kids film. (end) I'd give it 4 out of 5 stars,because being a young boy at the time,it seemed a little ""girlish"""
22319,My kids love this movie and have been asking to watch it again and again to watch it. I have enjoyed watching it again too. Though I have to admit it is not as good on a little TV.
22320,"Raggedy Ann & Andy is the first movie I ever saw in the theaters. My dad took my sister and I, and we said we want to watch Raggedy Ann & Andy again!"
22321,One of the best animated films I've seen in a long time.........

22323,"One of the best films I've ever seen, but it's now out-of-print. I've seen it more than once."
22324,"One of the funniest movies I have ever seen and enjoyed at the same time. And personally I think they should make a sequel. Mmm, yes a sequel indeed. Now i am even considering getting the captains bird tattooed somewhere on my body"
22325,"one of my favorites of all time! no, i'm not 10.. i'm 30! i own an old, original VHS of this that i bought from a rental store.."
22326,"Richard Willaims is an animation god. He was hampered in directing this film by the producer. The final product is a very uneven film with a very convoluted story, but some amazing moments of animation (like Emery Hawkins' ""Gre"

22329,The Camel with the Wrinkled Knees is a great movie for the whole family to watch. The Raggedy Ann and Andy Movie is so cute!
22330,"One of the best movies I've ever seen, and I've watched it over and over again since I was 10 years old. I still sing ""Hooray for me! Babbette of gay Paris!"" around my friends (I'"
22331,"It's still good, but it's not the same movie as the first one. I'm sure it's still good with the kids, but to us 20-30 somethings it's definitely got ""Cult Status"""
22332,"If you like Pavarotti, you'll like this movie. :)brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr"

22334,One of the best movies I've ever seen. He changed my view of opera. He deserves to be respected and admired for his talent. He will definitely be missed!!!
22335,One of the best movies I've ever seen...........
22336,The best Luciano Pavarotti film I've ever seen! I love it! I'd love to see it on DVD! I can't believe he's no longer with us!
22337,"I'm a big Pavarotti fan, but this movie is about hearing the voice of the star, and that alone is worth watching. A big opera star stuck on himself faces his fears, finds humility and love along the way."
22338,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time! I've seen it many times and just saw it again this afternoon. I'd forgotten how much I miss Pavarotti's singing of Nessun Dorma

22342,Not as 'gross-out' as the trailer had led me to expect. I was pleasantly surprised to find that How to Lose Friends and Alienate People was nowhere near as 'gross-out' a comedy as the trailer had led me
22343,One of the better romantic comedies I've seen in a long time! Simon Pegg and Kirsten Dunst are great! One of the funniest films I've seen in a long time!
22344,"Very funny & well worth a look at at the theaters. Simon Pegg, Jeff Bridges, Gillian Anderson, Kirsten Dunst, & Kirsten Dunst all did their job well."
22345,One of the best romantic comedies I've seen in a long time - and I'm not just saying that because it's Kirsten Dunst!
22346,Amazing performance from Simon Pegg who just gets better and better with every role. As usual he plays the part of a very cringy character who makes you want to hide behind...
22347,"One Of My Favourite Comedy's Of The Year. I Rate This Film 81%. I cant wait to see the third part of the blood and ice cream trilogy ""Paul"""
22348,One of those films where every little detail does pay tribute to a great piece of work. From transsexual strippers to an amazing soundtrack it all meshes nicely into what can only be described as clever comedy.
22349,One of the best romantic comedies I have seen in a long time..and I'm not just talking about Megan Fox...I'm talking about Simon Pegg..
22350,"An entertaining, if loose, adaptation of Toby Young's memoir of the same name. It's also a great title for helping to fill up the line requirement in..."
22351,How to lose friends and Alienate people is one of the funniest films of the year. Simon Pegg and Kirsten Dunst do a great job as Sidney Young and Sophie Maes.
22352,One of Simon Pegg's best performances in a long time. He's the star of the show here......
22353,"How To Lose Friends is a fictitious romcom, based on a real-life journalist's life experience.<n>Sidney Young is a stupid buffoon at the same time as being a smart, moderately skilled writer."
22354,"Bad start, solid middle, fantastic finish. That's my impression of this film, anyway. I liked Simon Pegg in the two films I've seen him in--- Hot Fuzz, and Shaun of the Dead."
22355,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. I'm a huge fan of Simon Pegg and this is one of his best.
22356,"This movie is about human relations, and the interaction between them. The main character is an old lady who at the twilight of her life starts a journey to her past, doing an analysis of how she lived her life."
22357,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best books I've ever read! I'm a Margaret Laurence fan!"

22361,"A pretty good remake of Vanishing Point, but it's not as good as the original. But it's still pretty good. I loved it."
22362,"I'm not a fan of the original, but I liked this movie. It's not a masterpiece but I did get into it quite a lot and it actually made me want to see the original."
22363,"It's a TV movie, but at least it doesn't have to be cheesy......."
22364,"its not as good as the first movie,but its a good solid movie its has good car chase scenes,on the remake of this movie there a story for are hero to drive fast as his trying to rush to the side of his ailing"
22365,"This was a good remake of a 70's film, but it had the suspense and action of a current film. He's running, desperate to be with his hospitalized wife, the police are the least concern. The chases were very"
22366,I really liked this version of 'Vanishing Point' as opposed to the 1971 version. I found the 1971 version quite boring. If I can get up in the middle of a movie a few times(as I did with the 1971 version
22367,"""Live Free or Die"" is the motto on Jason Priestly's hat as he brilliantly portrays ""the voice,"" and that sums up the dangerous (to some) message of this film"
22368,This is the best movie I've seen in a long time! I loved it! I can't wait to see the next one! I can't wait to see it!
22369,Brilliant use of overstated technicolor illustrates the optimistic extremes of present day Christmas ceremonies. The voyeuristic element during the scenes (Santa & Pedro summarize society's behavior peering through a telescope) is unique
22370,"The greatest Christmas movie of all time, and I'm not talking about any of the other movies I've seen. I'm talking about this one."
22371,One of my all-time favorite Christmas films!! I can't wait to get a copy!! I can't wait to watch it with my children as I explain to them my favorite parts and memories!!
22372,"One of the funniest films I've seen in a long, long time, and I'm not just saying that because I've seen it."
22373,"This is the worst thing I've ever seen. So bad in fact, that by sheer freakiness, this movie must get a ten rating because it has to be seen to be believed."

22376,"The best Spanish Santa Claus movie ever made! I've seen it every year since I was a little girl, and it's still the best!"
22377,Why is this movie rated so low? You can understand between the first 5 minutes that it's a good work. Really good actually. I even cried at the end of the movie. And the dancing routines are just sick.
22378,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time--and it's not just because it's a dance film!"

22382,"It's not Shawshank, but it's a good dance competition film, and the title sucks.<n>It's an American film, but it's not a US film."
22383,"Finally, a movie about popular African-influenced dance (step, breaking, or dancing) where the main character is a Black woman. I've seen too many movies where non-Black women are the main characters."

22386,this is really films outside (not in a motel room) with real costumes (not only strings and swimsuits). You have to see this movie. it's the only porn movie I know that is worth watching between the sex scenes.

22396,"A fun and entertaining film that will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way to the end. It will not win any Oscars, nor any DVD blockbuster sales, but a fun watch and a fun experience."
22397,"A good Korean film about what it takes to be a good guy. A good Korean film about not just Taekwondo but what its takes to be good, like a thugs way of fighting cannot beat a taekwondo guy in his sport because there"

22407,"This is a movie you will have to see twice in order to fully appreciate it. The camera-work and post production add much to the overall flavour of the film, making it quite artistic at some points and open to interpretation at others."

22462,One of those movies that make you feel better about the world and your dreams. One of those movies that are designed to make you feel better about the world and your dreams.
22463,A pleasant little film with Judy Garland at her very best in the role of Lily Mars. I think the comedy is light and nothing too heavy here. I really recommend this film for everyone. Judy is breathtaking in this role!
22464,"A cute film, but it could have been better. Judy Garland is great as always, but some scenes seem out of place and the romance between her and Van Heflin develops all too quickly."
22465,"Heflin's first big-time role in Judy Garland's ""The Wizard of Oz"" is not quite as good as he'd hoped"
22466,A charming film with Garland and Heflin as well as a couple of great performances from the cast of a Broadway show.....

22473,A very funny and especially nice looking film. The digital set design gives it a really nice look. It's a fantasy-world based on reality. Sometimes the touches of reality shine through (especially the water was impressive)

22484,"The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr. isn't a particularly good documentary. It's worth a watch for the Wood fan and those of cinema in general, but don't expect brilliance here"
22485,The delicate balance of right & wrong ( commonly seen on the busts of blind justice in the courts ) has powerlessness on one plate and prowess on another. Is the needle on the center a half-truth?
22486,Om Puri and Sadashiv Amrapurkar are brilliant in this film. Govind Nihalani's directorial venture of Vijay Tendulkar's novel is brilliant. Om Puri plays an inspector Velankar who is forced to protect underworld don

22554,"One of the best movies of all time, but does it live up to it's hype? I'm not saying it does, but I think it does."
22555,One of the greatest films of all time. James Cameron is a master storyteller. The film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises. The acting is wonderful as Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Jack and Kate Winslet who plays Rose became superstars overnight with the

22559,Titanic is a tragic adventure love story that makes you cry every time you watch it. James Cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the Titanic

22563,I loved this movie since I was 7 and I saw it on the opening day. It was so touching and beautiful. I strongly recommend seeing for all. It's a movie to watch with your family by far.
22564,"Why is ""Titanic"" only given a 7.0 rating by imdb.com users? Is it because of the hatred of Leonardo DiCaprio, or is it because of the overall motion picture?"
22565,"It's an Epic, it's a spectacle in the order of Gone With the Wind or Ben Hur. But this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million, an emotional rollercoaster that, if it were a regular one"
22566,"Titanic is the greatest movie of the 21st Century. With great acting,directing,effects,music and generally everything. This movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they didn't like it any more..."

22571,Aro Tolbukhin is one of the best movies I ve seen in a long time. It s like a movie made a documental or vice versa.
22572,"One of the best movies ever made by Villaronga, but it's slow and boring. But the second part is absolutely marvelous and makes the whole movie the best by Villaronga."
22573,"""Aro Tolbukhin"" is a serious work, so analytical, it's not morbid at all. Such a horrifying testimony about how some childhood trauma can turn a man into a monster"

22578,One of the best thrillers I've seen in a long time...and I've seen it more than once......
22579,"An intriguing premise, but the production felt rushed and holes were apparent. It certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort. Taupin must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort."

22592,"This is not the typical Mel Brooks film. It was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable. Leslie Ann Warren made the movie, she is such a fantastic, under-rated actress."
22593,"The most underrated film inn the Brooks cannon. Sure, its flawed. But it does not give a realistic view of homelessness (unlike, say, Citizen Kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers, or Titanic gave a realistic view of Italians"
22594,"Brilliant over-acting by Lesley Ann Warren. Best dramatic hobo lady I have ever seen, and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none. The corn on face is a classic, as good as anything in Blazing Saddles."

22600,"This is the kind of film you want to see with a glass of wine, the fire on, and with your feet up. It doesn't require that much brain-power to follow, so is very good after a long day."
22601,"""Life stinks"" is a parody of life and death, happiness and depression. The black and the white always present in our lives. Mel Brooks performance is brilliant as always, and the other actors work is fine too. This movie has some"

22692,"One of the best movies I've ever seen. It touched my heart. If it ever comes out on DVD, I will purchase it purely for sentimental reasons. Besides I am a Johnny Cash fan and it was a brave venture."
22693,"Johnny and June Carter Cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the Gospel stories. The music is great, you get a real feel of what the world of Jesus looked like (I've been there too)"
22694,"A fun look at the Gospel as presented by Johnny Cash (adorned in black, of course) who sings a lot and narrates a bit also. If you like Johnny Cash, this film is quite enjoyable."

22714,"""Right to Die"" is one of the best episodes of the second season of ""Masters of Horror""<n>The story of ""Right to Die"" cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia"
22715,"This is one of the best episodes from the second season of MOH, I think Mick Garris has a problem with women... He kill'em all, they are often the victims (Screwfly solution, Pro-life, Valerie on"
22716,"""Right to Die"" is not very suspenseful but it more than makes up for that with some outlandish set pieces and over the top gore. ""Right to Die"" benefits heavily from it's performers and is more than an OK way"
22717,A decent Masters of Horror episode that's not quite as bad as The Screwfly Solution 2006 but it's still worth a watch... & it's not for the faint of heart!
22718,It ruined a great episode and so I can only give it a 6. It was very Hellraiser what with all the skin though I dunno how anyone can survive without skin the skin is a vital organ...
22719,This is the first episode of the first season of Friends! =)                 
22720,The One Where Monica Gets A Roommate - The One Where Monica Gets A Roommate - The One Where Monica Gets A Roommate - The One Where Monica Gets A Roommate - The One Where Monica Gets A Room
22721,A great start to an unbeatable comedy! A great start to an unbeatable comedy! A great start to an unbeatable comedy! A great start to an unbeatable comedy! A great start to an unbeatable comedy! A great start to an unbeatable comedy!
22722,"The first episode of ""Friends"" is a must-see for all ""Friends"" fans! And that's how the greatest comedy of TV started!"
22723,"This is the first EVER episode of Friends, where we get introduced to Monica Gellar, Ross Gellar, Hippy Pheobe Buffay, Hippy Pheobe Buffay, Courtney Cox, Matt Le Blanc and Chandler Bing!"
22724,"This was the beginning of it all! Granted, this is not Friends at its best, but this was the show's pilot, let's not forget and not a bad one at that"
22725,"One of Miike's most perfectly formed films. He says if he made it again it would be different, but not necessarily better. I think what he means is that the film possesses a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so"
22726,"Miike's Triad Society Trilogy kicks off to a great start. Shinjuku Triad Society is about a cop trying to prevent his kid brother from getting too involved with a rather extreme gang of outsiders, struggling their way to the top of Tokyos"
22727,"One of Takashi Miike's first films, but it's not as surreal as he'd like it to be...."
22728,Shinjuku Triad Society: Chinese Mafia Wars is unlikely to get distribution in the West outside film festivals. Why? Could your censors stomach a film where policemen anally rape male and female suspects to get...
22729,Not as good as Miiki but not as bad as I thought it would be........
22730,"Not as wild and way out as some of Takashi Miike's later films this is a very good crime drama. A word of warning, the violence when it happens is explosive and nasty. There are also semi-graphic depictions of gay"
22731,"A little bit of Miike's earlier work, but still a good bit of pulp fiction......."
22732,"One of the most shocking films I've seen in a long, long time - and it's not just because it's Miike's!"
22733,"I really like Miikes movies about Yakuza, this one I saw about 2 years ago and it really fu**ed my head. Never before seen such a sick and twisted thing"
22734,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
22735,"An excellent film... McGovern takes great pains to research and document his writing and it pays off. He is not afraid to tell the truth, even though it might draw unfavourable reviews and comments from some who like stories to be clean and sweet and"
22736,One of the best films ever made about the atrocity in Derry 30 years ago. The film is as close to the truth as we will get until the outcome of the Saville enquiry.
22737,"""The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr."" is the definitive documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as ""Glen or Glenda"", ""Bride of the Monster"", and ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"
22738,"One of the best films I've ever seen about Ed Wood Jr., and it's not for the faint of heart....."
22739,I've seen all of Wood's films and they're just terrible. I wouldn't say he was the worst director ever but he's down there. Do we really need a docu on a very mediocre film maker
22740,"One of Fred Schepisi's best movies ever. Definitely one of Fred Schepisi's best movies ever. Definitely one of the biggest disasters resulting from the existence of mass media, regardless of any media outlet's political views"
22741,"""A dingo ate moy baby! A dingo ate moy baby! A dingo ate moy baby! A dingo ate moy baby! A dingo ate moy baby!"""
22742,"A true story of an Australian couple charged with murder when their infant child disappeared. Meryl Streep is excellent, as always, and manages to hold our interest even though she plays a character who isn't particularly likable."
22743,One of Streep's Best Performances in All of Her Filming.<n>One of the Best Films of All Time....
22744,"I've been reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyone's guilt ever since the book ""Evil Angels"" came out. I was thrilled that a movie was going to be made about the case and don't think it could have"
22745,A CRY IN THE DARK is an ugly film to watch. It presents a scenario that's all too real for us in America: the witch-hunt against a person deemed an easy target.
22746,"Not bad, but not as good as you'd expect from a movie about a murder case. Neill and Streep are excellent...."
22747,"One of the best docudramas I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time."
22748,One of Meryl Streep's best performances. A bit different. A bit different. A pretty good film. A bit different. A bit different. A pretty good film. A bit different.
22749,"One of the best movies I've seen in a very long time, and one of Meryl Streep's best as well...."
22750,"It's hard to like anyone in this film. The central characters are not bad people, but then surely not all, or even most, of the scores of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we knew them better."
22751,"A shocking look in the mirror at what we as a country did to a family who just wanted justice to be served, and the truth to be known."
22752,"Fascinating movie, based on a true story, about an Australian woman, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) accused of killing her baby daughter. She insists that a dingo took her baby, but the story is highly suspicious."
22753,An Under-appreciatted Classic............
22754,"The right to be presumed ""Innocent until proven guilty"" is a basic entitlement of anyone in a civilised society...."
22755,"Religious bigotry is rampant everywhere. Australia is not immune to it. I don't mean to spoil the story for you, but you need to know the basics before..."
22756,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
22757,I believe they were telling the truth the whole time..U cant trust anything in the wild... They family went through hell.Those poor boys too young to understand what was going on around them. But still having to deal with the
22758,"One of those movies that made me feel strongly for the need of making movies at all. And this one is GREAT! Besides Meryl's performance which has gained a lot of recognition and praise, the movie's greatest asset is the story"
22759,Meryl Streep is the best actress I've seen in a long time. This movie is very good. The screenplay is enchanting. But Meryl Streep is most impressive. She brings me to go into the heart of her role.
22760,"Delightful minor film, comedy juggling and detective, romance and drama genres as nimbly as Lt Kenny Williams (Melvyn Douglas) balances his devotion to his girl Maxine Carroll (Joan Blondell)"
22761,"One of the best screwball comedies of the 1940's, but it's a long time away from coming out on DVD......"
22762,The only review of this movie as of this date really trashes the stars and the movie itself. I found the movie and the performances fun and enjoyable.
22763,"Melvyn Douglas and Joan Blondell co-star in a 1939 mystery/comedy that's quite good, although forgotten, probably due to the number of incredible films that came out in 1939"
22764,"The ""Amazing Mr. Williams"" stars Melvyn Douglas, who did five films in 1939, one of which was Ninotchka with Garbo. His co-star was Joan Blondell (Maxine), who ALSO did five films that year"
22765,"One of the best detective films I've seen in a long time, and it's just as good now as it was in the first one."
22766,"NORMAN was the comedy of the month in whenever 1976 and everyone seemed to see it, laugh about it and then never ever mention it ever again. NORMAN is a raucous politically incorrect closet slamming farce that The Farrelly Brothers should look at"
22767,"One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it many times, and I've never seen it with Redd Foxx in it."
22768,"""I'll kill him. I'll kill him. I'll kill him."" ""Why won't he wake up?"" ""Why won't he wake up?"" ""Why won't he wake up?"""

22770,"Love,lust,strange family ties this movie qualifies for a come back encore performance, comedy with a mix of events as this could and should find its way as a remake"
22771,One of the best films ever made about the Nazi's reign of terror........
22772,One of the best films I've seen in a long time. Knox's performance is chilling. Hunt's is superb.. I'll give it 8 out of 10.
22773,"""Gorky Park"" is one of the best films ever made about the Nazi's occupation of Poland and the people of the town of Gorky Park."
22774,One of the best films I've ever seen about Nazi atrocities..and it's not just propaganda...it's a real drama..
22775,"An effective film that stays with you once it's finished. Knox is unrepentant as a bitter, resentful and evil man. Martha Hunt has some powerful moments and matches him with her strength and Henry Travers is also very good in"
22776,"THE VERGER, MR. KNOW-IT-ALL, &amp; SANITORIUM--A dandy follow-up to QUARTET, well worth watching"
22777,"The Verger, Mr. Know-All, &amp; The 3rd &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp"
22778,Trio's vignettes were insightful and quite enjoyable. It was curious seeing so many soon to be famous actors when they were very young. The performances and attention to detail were wonderful to watch.
22779,One of the best films I've seen in a long time - and I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once.
22780,"A lesser achievement than QUARTET, but still done with the utmost care, acted with verve by a stellar cast and is solidly enjoyable into the bargain."
22781,One of the greatest films of all time - and one of the best of all time - in a very short period of time........
22782,"One of the funniest films I've seen in a long time,and I've seen it many times. I've seen it many times."
22783,"Campy, campy, campy, campy, campy, campy, campy, campy, campy, campy, campy, campy, campy, campy, campy, campy,"
22784,"This is a VERY entertaining movie. A few of the reviews that I have read on this forum have been written by people who, apparently, think that the film was an effort at serious drama. IT WAS NOT MADE THAT WAY....It is"
22785,"It's fun, but the movie rode in on the coattails of the 60's-created concept that comic books could only be done as ""camp"" (i.e., the 60's Batman show) for TV"
22786,"Most people miss Hollywood's point of concept. If a hero can stimulate heroic deeds to the mind of a child, within the confines of the law then I, approve of the lessons being taught by Doc Savage"
22787,"Doc Savage, the lord he's here! I give it 7 out of 10. I give it 7 out of 10. I give it 7 out of 10."
22788,"Great fun from start to finish! (and you'll be singing the John Phillip Sousa adapted theme song for days afterwards guaranteed!) (and you'll be ordering coke, lemonade and milk at a formal occasion!)"
22789,The Great Depression provided a temporary escape from the harsh realities of life in the 1930's and '40's. Baseball provided a pleasant interlude from World's Events and Comedy Shows for a pleasant interlude from harsh reality.
22790,"It's not as good as it should have been, but it's not as bad as it could've been..."
22791,"Remember these two stories fondly and in the first, set in the not too distant future, we see a young boy preparing for examination day, the state i.q test."
22792,"A good episode of The New Twilight Zone that actually includes interesting ideas and clever stories (I note both of them are based on short stories).""Examination Day"" is set in the future, year unknown but at a point where they have cake"
22793,Two of my favorite episodes in this new version of Twilight Zone. Maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned. It's a little bit more mawkish and sentimental than Serling's version.
22794,China O'Brien was an attempt to make Cynthia Rothrock a star in the United States. Sadly he was either lucky with Enter the Dragon or he's lost his touch because he's not that great of a director.
22795,"One of my favorite ""goof on"" movies, even if it's bad........"
22796,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it stars Jim Carrey. It's because it stars Morgan Freeman."
22797,"What a conceptual NIGHTMARE. What a conceptual NIGHTMARE. Jim Carrey playing God? Well, this movie is hardly sacred, but it also is not sacrilegious, at least not to any great extent."
22798,"If you're not sure, watch the trailer. I saw the trailer three times and still laughed at the same gags when I saw the film. If you don't find the sight of a dog putting the seat down after using"
22799,"Better than ""Oh, God"", better than ""Oh, God"", better than ""Oh, God"", better than ""Oh, God"", better than ""Oh, God"", better than ""Oh, God"""
22800,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it's a Jim Carrey movie. It's because it's a Jim Carrey movie."
22801,It's a good-hearted film that should offend very few. Kudos to the writers for at least getting that correct and giving a good message. It's a good-hearted film that should offend very few.
22802,"If you want a serious laugh pain, watch this movie, and the things Bruce inflicts on his fellow newscaster. The deleted scenes are priceless. I don't know why they didn't include them in the original movie."
22803,"""Bruce Almighty"" looks and sounds incredibly stupid, especially from the trailers. Nevertheless, I found in it a deeper message that actually made me like this film more"
22804,"Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good and Morgan Freeman seems right at home as God and the cast brings the plot together well. The jokes are almost always on target, although sometimes they resort a bit too much on Carrey'"
22805,The best Jim Carrey film ever made. I rate this film a 9/10. I rate this film a 9/10. I rate this film a sequel to this film a 9/10. I rate this film a 9/10. I rate this film a 9/10.
22806,One of Jim Carrey's best pictures since... well... a long time. It contains one of the funniest scenes I have seen for a long time too... Morgan Freeman plays God well and even chips in a few jokes that are surprisingly funny
22807,A very funny movie. It was good to see Jim Carrey back in top form. Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston both played outstanding supporting roles in this film.
22808,"Jim Carrey is very funny, Jennifer Aniston is great, Morgan Freeman is cool, and Steven Carell is very funny. A very good film. I would rate it a 9."
22809,One of the funniest films I've seen in a long time. I'm glad to see Jim Carrey in a movie where being over the top wasn't the goal. His character is like all of us.
22810,"This movie is very entertaining though. Went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the ""I think there might be something in my eye"" routine."
22811,Fairly funny Jim Carrey vehicle that has him as a News reporter who temporarily gets the power of God and wrecks havoc. Jennifer Aniston as his put upon girlfriend is also charming and affecting.
22812,I laughed out loud and left with a smile. I feel like I got my money's worth. I feel like I got my money's worth.
22813,One of the funniest movies so far this 2003 season (late May) and a good improvement on Carrey's past crazy and personally forgetable roles in past comedies.
22814,"Carreyism' is back! Bruce Almighty' is not the most in-depth Carrey film, but it is still an almighty chuckling exhibition of Carreyism'!"
22815,"I'm a big Jim Carrey fan, but I don't know what I'm talking about. I don't know what I'm talking about."
22816,"BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a very funny film that had something positive to say. It wasn't one of Jim Carrey's best performances, but he was still OK. Morgan Freeman was just right as God. Jennifer Aniston had"
22817,"Jim Carrey's best work since The Truman Show. A pleasant surprise after some of his recent ""Hey Hollywood - look how good I can act!"" box office disappointments. It's great to see Jim recognizing and embracing his strengths."
22818,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.........
22819,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more than once. I loved it. I'll watch it again and again.
22820,Don't watch this movie if you don't want to be surprised by the funny scenes in the previews. Just watch the previews and you'll be just as satisfied.
22821,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time. I'll watch it again and again. I'm so glad I did."
22822,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time."
22823,"David Mamet's first psychological thriller, a must-see for any Mamet fan......."
22824,"House of Games is a fine mystery and a shocking thriller. It is blessed with marvelous performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Montegna, and a strong, strong cast of supporting players"
22825,"""House of Games"" is a dark look at the underside of human nature that concludes on a note of discomforting ambiguity. It will hold your attention every second while you are watching, and stay with you for a long time afterwards."
22826,"Not as good as ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" but it's still fun to watch......"
22827,House of Games is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It's the best movie about con artists I've ever seen.
22828,"One of the best con movies I've seen in a long, long time; and it's not just because it stars Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna."
22829,"""What's life without adventure? Put your Reality Check on a low setting and enjoy swimming with the sharks!"" Put your Reality Check on a low setting and enjoy swimming with the sharks!"
22830,"This is very nearly a perfect film. The ideas would be repeated by Mamet, but never told so succinctly. This is really about the failure of trust, of the human condition."
22831,"Mamet, Bach, Bach, Bach, Bach, Bach, Bach, Bach, Bach, Bach, Bach, Bach, Bach, Bach, Bach, Bach, Bach, Bach, Bach, Bach, Bach, Bach, Bach, Bach"
22832,"One of David Mamet's best films, and one of his best movies ever........"
22833,"This is a gripping movie about grifters. But who is conning who here? I was very surprised that I liked this movie, because I don't usually go for this genre but this one kept him hooked until the end"
22834,House of Games is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. It's one of the best con films I've ever seen.
22835,The gun had blanks and it was provided to her from the very beginning. It's extremely original because of the hidden ending and how it cons MOST of the audience.
22836,"A great movie about relationships, deceit, and trust, with a cutting critique of psychiatry. Highly, hugely recommended! Has Mr Mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy?"
22837,"A film destined to be on late-night TV long after the present instant ""money-makers"" have long been forgotten. Perhaps a little too subtle for today's youngsters"
22838,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long, long time!"
22839,"A quiet, evenly paced insight into what makes a confidence man good. Explored as a psychological study by a noted psychologist (Lindsay Crouse), it slowly pulls her into his world with the usual nasty consequences."
22840,"Mamet's ""The House of Games"" is worth a look for first-timers and an okay rerun for Mamet fans. (B+)"
22841,"One of the best gambling movies of the 90's, if not the 100's......."
22842,"Unique movie about confused woman (Lindsay Crouse) who gets involved with sharp con men. Joe Mantegna gives an Oscar-caliber performance as the slickest of the group. Absolutely enchanting first hour, as Mantegna shows Crouse ""the"

22846,"It's not supposed to be a horror film, it's supposed to be a low budget ipecac...."
22847,One of the most disturbing horror films of the 90's.A must-see for fans of the genre.The idea of making a snuff film is pretty gruesome.
22848,Guinea Pig: Devil's Experiment is one of the better videos in the series...but it's not as good as some of the other ones.
22849,The Devils Experiment is NOT for everybody. It's for thrill seekers and gorehounds only. If you think Jason movies and Freddy Krueger movies are awesome then stick to those. But if your on the next level and have seen it
22850,what can i say about this film that hasnt already been said? well to tell the truth alot of it looks very fake like some of the slaps and the kicks. how charlie sheen though this was real i dont know.
22851,"Gorehounds probably won't find anything special. But, gorehounds probably won't find anything special. But, this film is a sure way to clear all but the most tolerant of rooms."
22852,"This is one of the best Guinea Pig Movies. At the same time, it looks realistic and unrealistic, just knowing that the movie is fake. The story is about a woman who got captured and is tortured in a lot of different ways."
22853,"Guinea Pig 2 is a great sequel to the first one. It's better than the first one, but it's still a great movie. I've already seen the first one."
22854,"This movie has no story. It's only about a bunch of guys who tortures an innocent young girl to death. This is what they do: They beat her, put her in a net and let her hang inside like birdfood"
22855,"It's not a snuff movie, it's not a snuff movie, it's not a snuff movie, it's not a snuff movie, it's not a snuff movie, it's not a snuff movie"
22856,The best fake snuff film ever made : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : 
22857,Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment is a raw creepy and disturbing look into the dark side of human nature. This movie gets right to the point. The point is to satisfy fan's of just extreme violence and gore.
22858,"The first out of the Guinea Pig series, and is one of the more infamous films out of the collection.brbrIt took me a long time to finally man up and get my hands on a copy of this notorious group of"
22859,"Devil's Experiment is a short film with no story, no character development. Just 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes. I did enjoy the flick but I don't know if I can really recommend this unless you have seen"
22860,"One of the best foreign gore movies I've ever seen, and I've seen it more than once! I can't believe it's banned in the U.S."
22861,"This movie sucks, but it still stands up against most of the crap made these days sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks"
22862,"one of the best 90's kids movies of all time, and one of the best of the 80's too!!!!!!!!!!!!! "
22863,"Not just a kiddie version of ""Jurassic Park"", but a thoughtful look at the nature of beings from one era into ours. John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Year"
22864,its great i loved it ha cause i love dinosaurs they r the greatest animals but i loved the show cause it wasn't copied from another show and it was a originals ha it has a good storyline and great for little kids (if

22866,"This is a great movie for kids and adults of all ages. I don't get the rating, honestly I don't. I don't get the rating, honestly I don't."
22867,"Dinosaurs in New York, New York, New York, Dinosaurs in New York, Dinosaurs in New York, Dinosaurs in New York, Dinosaurs in New York, Dinosaurs in New York, Dinosaurs in New York,"
22868,"A nice movie to watch in a boring afternoon,when you are looking for something different than the regular scripts and wants to have some fun. I mean,the whole idea of this movie and all the marijuana in it is such a craziness!"
22869,"Excellent view of a mature woman, that is going to lose everything (even the pruner has a mortgage) and it's mixed perfectly to give us as result a fresh, light and funny comedy"
22870,"This movie is inspiring to anyone who is or has been in a tough jam. :) You will definitely laugh, which is the best medicine! :) Even my boyfriend liked it so don't think that it's a chick-flic"
22871,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time! I'm a big fan of Brenda Blythen and Phyllida Law's acting!
22872,"A gentle comedic gem, until the last five minutes, which degenerate into run of the mill British TV farce. The last five minutes cost it 2 points in my rating."
22873,"A simple story, told and acted well. Brenda Blethyn gives a layered and warming performance as the recently widowed and financially straitened Grace, ably assisted by a solid supporting cast."
22874,"Funny, but not as funny as you'd expect.............."
22875,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and Brenda Blethyn's the star of the show! I can't wait to see it again!"
22876,A feel good movie with it's heart in the right place. Grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts. She could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start
22877,"""Saving Grace"" is never riotously funny, but delivers quite a few good laughs and I enjoyed it to a significant degree. Brenda Blethyn is a fine actress, and does a good job at portraying widower Grace, who resorts to"
22878,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time! brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr"
22879,"""Saving Grace"" is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time...and it's not just because of Brenda Blethyn!"
22880,"A fun-filled romp with real funny one-liners, a stellar and very funny performance by Peter O'Toole, a grounding and down to earth performance from Joan Plowright"
22881,I love this film. It's one of those I can watch again and again. It is acted well by a good cast that doesn't try too hard to be star studded.
22882,"A sweet little movie which would not even offend your Grandmother, ""Saving Grace"" seems cut from the same cloth as a half-dozen other British comedies over the past two years...underdog is faced with adversity, finds the strength to challenge"

22890,Loved it and hope it will someday come out on DV. Loved it and hope it will someday come out on DV. I also bought the sound track to this movie (very hard to get)

22894,MonsterVision was a great show for the 90's and early 2000's. I'm glad it's no longer available on DVD. I loved it.

22899,An entertaining film that steals more money in it's plot than time from you. 7/10. All in all it's an entertaining film that steals more money in it's plot than time from you.
22900,A VOW TO CHERISH is one of the movies that now constitutes a real surprise I have received from cinema. Here are some arguments of mine why I consider this film a highly underrated piece of good cinema.
22901,"Beautiful, touching, and very emotional movie. Great acting and great family values. Inspiring and touching. I loved it, and enjoyed it as much as the first time."
22902,"A Vow to Cherish is a wonderful movie. It's based on a novel of the same title, which was equally good, though different from the film. Really made you think about how you'd respond if you were in the shoes"
22903,"A powerful film with a powerful message of love and redemption. I loved the transformation of the brother and the repercussions of the horrible disease on the family. Well-acted and well-directed. If there were any flaws, I'd have"

22907,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and it's not just for entertainment. It's for the heart and mind."
22908,One of the most touching romantic films ever made...and it's not just because it's a boy-meets-girl movie. It's because it's so true.
22909,A film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental. Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise is pure cinematic brilliance.
22910,"One of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen. brbr""Before Sunrise"" is one of my favorite romances, indeed one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen. brbr"""
22911,"I want to see them as soon as possible again. I have to say i was now becoming misanthropist and felt like if love was just a fake, a concept, but with this movie i realized that maybe somewhere, somehow and some"
22912,"""Before Sunrise"" is a wonderful love story and has to be among my Top 5 favorite movies ever. Dialog and acting are great. I love the characters and their ideas and their thoughts."

22920,One of the 90's best thinking person's romantic movies. Julie Delpy turns in one of the decade's most engaging performances as the Parisian lass who spends a day with stranger-on-a-train Ethan Hawke.
22921,"One of the best movies about love I've ever seen. Closely followed by ""Before Sunset"", which technically isn't another movie at all, since it's about the same two people and the same romance."
22922,"One of the most observant character studies of the 90s, and one of the best films I've seen in a long time...."
22923,One of the best movies I have seen from the 1990s! One of the best movies I have seen from the 1990s! One of the best movies I have seen from the 1990s!
22924,I was totally satisfied with the outcome and everything else. People I talked to said there was too much talking! It's a very personal film that doesn't speak to all people. But it certainly spoke to me.

22929,the most amazing combination of love and psyche of two young people.presented in the most sublime manner and definitely touches your heart.a rare combination where the sequel surpasses the prequel in both storytelling and intensity of emotions.
22930,"Love is a strange thing. When you really want it, it will not come as you wished. Without it, love will not last long. Spiritual harmony is the most important for love."

22935,"One of the best romantic movies I've seen in a long, long time........"
22936,"""Before Sunrise"" is a breath of fresh air to a genre that has been in decline. Written and directed by Richard Linklater, ""Before Sunrise"" never bores because of its' small cast."
22937,"I like it because of my recent personal experience. Especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite. The characters in the firm did not really enjoy their ""real"" lives, but they did enjoy themselves, i.e."

22941,"Mario Lanza is ""The Great Caruso"" in this 1951 film also starring Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten, Eduard Franz and Ludwig Donath. This is a highly fictionalized biography of the legendary, world-renowned tenor whose name is known even today"
22942,"One of the most beautiful films I've seen in a long time. The color photography is beautiful as it shows the lavishness of the Metropolitan Opera House in brilliant color. Other indoor scenes at various mansions, etc are equally brilliant."
22943,"One of Lanza's best performances, but Ann Blyth's acting is not up to her standard......"
22944,MARIO LANZA is the best voice god of the 20th century.........

22954,"A pure fantasy movie from start to finish. It has flying horses, genies, flying carpets, and wizards that can actually do magic instead of just hit people with their staffs. It doesn't have any cheesy moments and the love"
22955,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It's on TV late at night and early in the morning. Please put it on prime time.
22956,"""The Thief of Bagdad"" is one of the best films I have ever seen. John Justin is brilliant in the role of a young prince in love and then some."

22958,The Thief of Bagdad is one of the best adventure films of the 20th century and still holds on to it's quality while I grew up.
22959,One of the best westerns of the 20th century. A must have for any fan of westerns. It's a must have for anyone who's ever seen it.

22963,"One of the two finest motion pictures ever made by Alexander Korda and London Films---and one of the finest fantasy films ever made!brbrA true, compelling classic!"
22964,"My eight-year-old's favorite movie, and it's not just because it's a classic. It's because it's a classic."
22965,"One of the best fairy tales of all time, but it falls apart in the final 15 minutes of the film. I've given it an 8 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of ten, which is where a good portion of"
22966,"The making of The Thief Of Bagdad is quite a story unto itself, almost as wondrous as the tale told in this film. Alexander Korda nearly went broke making this film."
22967,"It's all great fun; Justin and June Duprez are the love interest for the mums and dads, Veidt is the boo-hiss, and Abu is the youthful, irrepressible robber"
22968,"One of the best children's films of all time, but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays. This probably would count as one of the great children's films of all time, but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays."
22969,A magical journey concocted by Alexander Korda and Michael Powell. These two TITANS of the British cinema have mixed some fabulous ingredients to produce a movie masterpiece!
22970,"I loved every minute of it. A lavish fantasy in true Arabian-Nights style. There's an evil magician, a pretty princess, a djinn and everybody lives happily ever after."
22971,"This is a beautiful movie filled with adventure. The Genii in the bottle is a classic scene. Romantic in it's finish, all things turn out as they should be."
22972,"Very rare for a film to appeal to viewers of all ages--to children for a fine narrative and a wonderful, colorful production, all bound together with a fine Rozsa score"
22973,"One of the greatest fantasy films of all time, and still one of my all-time favorite films. It's a true adventure of enchantment throughout, and, along with ""Robin Hood,"" it's my desert island film."
22974,One of the best movies I've ever seen. I've seen it over and over. I've seen it over and over. I've seen it over and over. I've seen it over and over.

22976,It's not bad at all. The real star is of course the General Lee. The car chases and stunts are excellent and that's really what D.O.H. is all about.
22977,"what is wrong with you people, i don't think it was aiming to be, i think it was just fun and funny, i loved it."
22978,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time! I'm glad I've seen this one! I'm glad I did!
22979,"It's been 30 years since I watched this original PBS film, and it's finally available on DVD! Happy New Year, ladies! This wonderful film is finally available on DVD at ladyslipper.org"
22980,"One of the most beautiful movies I've seen in a long time, yet it's still missing a video on DVD. I've been searching for Frances Lee McCain for 30 years."
22981,This movie has been a constant in my mind after 30 years. I recall going to the library researching all that I could on this story. I even wrote to the PBS station for more information.
22982,"One of my all-time great movie moments. I don't think of this as a ""gay movie,"" it's an interesting and tender period love story, where the two principals happen to be women."
22983,"one of the best movies i've ever seen, and one of the best movies i've ever seen. i wish i could see it again."
22984,Plato's run is an entertaining b movie with Gary Busey.it is a fairly unknown film so one i saw it at a car boot i thought this looks entertaining i was right to
22985,"I liked this film, but I was disappointed in the foot-curling scene. :) It was a side foot curl, rather than the appropriate laces blast. :) I am of course kidding. :)"
22986,"A film I expected very little from, and only watched to pass a quiet hour - but what an hour it turned out to be. Roll is an excellent if none-too-serious little story of 'country-boy-lost-in"

22990,"More fun than the average Hollywood blockbuster. Malone puts in a commendable performance as a bucolic teenager. There are telltale signs of a low budget, but as with so many other low-budget movies there's more fun, seemingly more spontaneity,"
22991,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time, and it's from Australia, a country I've always wanted to visit!"
22992,"This is an extremely powerful based-on-a-true story film that can be infuriating to watch. I say that because how brutal a hounding press can be to people, in this case an innocent Australian couple charged with killing their baby"
22993,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time, but it's a good one, and I'm glad I saw it."

22999,"One of the best Cannon Movie Tales I've ever seen, and it's not just because it's a love story. It's because it's beautiful."
23000,"One of the most underrated 80's horror films ever made, and it's worth a check out for a few reasons............"
23001,One of Barbara Bach's best performances... and one of Stephen Furst's best as a creepy old house voyeur           
23002,"""The Unseen"" is a solid little horror flick worthy of discovery.brbrA deliciously unhinged Lassick plays the true monster in this disturbing little horror movie."
23003,"""The Unseen"" is a slow and predictable but potent early 80's film that will certainly appeal to fans of 70's exploitation and generally weird stuff. Sydney Lassick is truly the ideal choice for the role of Ernest Keller."
23004,"The Unseen is a good movie, but it's not as good as you'd expect. It's a little slow, but it's still worth watching."
23005,"Well-made little shocker, suffering a bit from some redundant dialogue-scenes and a rather thin plot-line (that doesn't do very well in hiding its secrets)"
23006,This is a long lost horror gem starring Sydney Lassick and Barbara Bach. It is sometimes difficult to locate a copy of this film but it's worth it.
23007,"It's cheesy, it's creepy, it's gross, but that's what makes it so much fun. Rent it for a good laugh."
23008,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.........
23009,"Charming slice-of-life in the Ozarks in the same vein as ""Where The Lillies Bloom"" & ""The Dollmaker"" & ""The Dollmaker"""
23010,"I love this film. It is understated and low-key, but deeply heartfelt. Henry Thomas' (he played the child in E.T.) performance is masterfully inarticulate (he is supposed to be a man of few words"
23011,"One of the most interesting movies I have ever seen. I love the backwoods feel of this movie. The movie is very realistic and believable. This seems to take place in another era, maybe the late 60's or early 70's"
23012,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Henry Thomas was the real star of the show. I loved it. I'd watch it again and again.
23013,"A quiet, little film that doesn't overwhelm you with special effects or ""big"" performances. It simply takes you into the lives of the people living in a small hamlet in the backwoods of North Carolina."
23014,"One of the best westerns I've seen in a long time, but it's not as good as I'd like it to be."
23015,"A good movie, even if the third act turned into horrible hollywood resolution that could've killed this movie. Henry Thomas showed a restraint, even when the third act turned into horrible hollywood resolution that could've killed this movie."
23016,"It's not ""gay rights"" but rather for anyone who has ever been ostracized as a child for ANYTHING. I was happy to see an entertaining cartoon that actually conveyed a LIFE MESSAGE to its audience."

23018,Stanley Holloway & Dame Margaret Rutherford star in this very funny British comedy about a small town's independence from the rest of the UK.....
23019,"A very funny Ealing comedy about a community in central London who, through an unusual set of circumstances, discover they are not English, but are an annex of the French province of Burgundy."
23020,"""Passport to Pimlico"" is a wonderful little film about the joys and problems of being an independent state of Great Britain at a time when rationing was still in operation."
23021,"Very funny, well-crafted, well-acted, meticulous attention to detail. A real window into a specific time and place in history. Could almost believe this was a true story in a parallel universe."
23022,"Passport to Pimlico is a gem of a film, one of the best I've seen in a long, long time! I've seen it more than once!"
23023,A satire against the post war world of rationing and the welfare state. I do not think this is the point of the film at all. The film parodies the spivs(small time criminals who ran the blackmarket) and the housewives league
23024,"The theory that the Ealing comedies were intended as satires on ""Attlee's Britain"", the Britain which had come into being after the Labour victory in the 1945 general election"
23025,"Passport to Pimlico is a real treat for all fans of British cinema. Not only is it an enjoyable and thoroughly entertaining comedy, but it is a cinematic flashback to a bygone age, with attitudes and scenarios sadly now only a memory in British life"
23026,"Excellent, exquisite, Ealing wins again, my wartime-Glasgow-raised mother would love this, should I ever find a copy of it. Some of Britain's best artists, from Mr Holloway to Wayne and Radford and the delicious Miss Rutherford"
23027,"Pleasant story of the community of Pimlico in London who, after an unexploded WW2 bomb explodes, find a Royal Charter stating that the area they live in forms part of Burgundy."
23028,"One of the best Ealing comedies I've seen in a long, long time.<n>The moral of the story isn't forced down your throat"
23029,This series was a cut above the rest of the TV detective series of the day but somehow didn't find an audience. Well you never know... one day Paramount might just dig into its archives and release it on DVD!
23030,"Longstreet was a good show, but it was canceled after one season because it was not able to compete with Raymond Burr's Ironside. I hope that a box set of Longstreet will appear."
23031,"Mary Woronov, Lynn Lowry, George Shannon, &amp; Gershon Kingsley make this a sexy, suspenseful gem......."
23032,"A dark fable for adults. A dark fable for adults. Exploitation is a theme of Sugar Cookies, and one wonders if the cast has not fallen prey to..."
23033,"One of the best films in Troma's library, and yet again one of those films that defy the curious fantasy that their catalog is one of bad taste"
23034,"Footlight Parade is among the best of the 1930's musical comedy extravaganzas. A snappy script and an all-star cast including Jimmy Cagney, the lovely Joan Blondell, Dick Powell, and Ruby Keeler make this film"
23035,"""Footlight Parade"" is fascinating on so many levels. There is no way the supposedly staged ""theater prologues"" could have been produced in any theater on earth"
23036,Footlight Parade is Busby Berkeley at his surreal best. John Garfield is seen briefly in a B western starring John Wayne. The Duke's voice is unmistakable.
23037,James Cagney at his quisessential BEST! He's fast with the one-liners! He's fast with his feet! This is James Cagney at his quisessential BEST!
23038,"""Footlight Parade"" stands on its own as one of the most amazing and outrageous would-be musicals of 1933. James Cagney's dancing appeared natural and unrehearsed, although hours went into practice to get each"
23039,One of the best movies of the 30's...........
23040,Cagney & Berkeley's FOOTLIGHT PARADE at it's very best.<n>Cagney & Berkeley's FOOTLIGHT PARADE at it's very best.
23041,"James Cagney at his best in ""Footlight Parade"", one of the best of the early 1930's musicals......."
23042,One of the best films I have ever seen in all my years of film-making. I will gladly watch this film again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and
23043,"Cagney and Blondell are great, but the musical numbers don't live up to their billings....."
23044,Cagney is always terrific. Blondel charms you with her wit and energy. It's obvious that this is a pre-censorship film by the innuendo in the script
23045,This is a wonderful film. The non-stop patter takes several watchings to fully appreciate. I think this movie easily outdoes all of his other efforts. Joan Blondell and James Cagney are incredible together
23046,"An excellent example of the spectacular Busby Berkeley musicals produced in the early 1930's. Quite a contrast from his ""Public Enemy"" 2 years earlier. Cagney does add spark & interest to a rather routine tired out formulated storyline &"
23047,One of James Cagney's All-Too-Few Musicals...and It's A Wonderful Showcase of Talent...And It's Worth Waiting For!

23052,"A wonder. One of the best musicals ever. The three Busby Berkely numbers that end the movie are spectacular, but what makes this film so wonderful is the incredible non-stop patter and the natural acting of Cagney and Blonde"
23053,"James Cagney, Dick Powell, Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler, Scott Blair, &amp; Ruby Keeler sing &amp; dance!"
23054,Footlight is the best of the three Warner Brothers musicals from 1933.........
23055,This is the definitive 30's musical with a knockout frenetic performance from Jimmy Cagney. One of the last releases before the Motion Picture Production Code was strictly enforced.
23056,One of the best movies of the 30's... and one of the best musical movies of all time! I can't believe I've seen it!
23057,One of Busby Berkley's best. He's at his best. He's at his best. He's at his best. He's at his best. He's at his best.
23058,"Footlight Parade (1933) - James Cagney, Joan Blondell, Dick Powell, Ruby Keeler, Billy Barty, &amp; Ruby Keeler"
23059,"Cagney at his best as a stage-producer in this ""talking"" movie. Joan Blondell is fabulous as the neglected love-interest Nan, she gives such a spirited performance that is so unusual for movies of that time."
23060,Don't waste your time and money on someone who doesn't know what they're talking about! I'm sick and tired of being force fed the same old bubble-gum trash movies!

23063,"A smart, slightly twisted comedy that makes you think. I wasn't quite sure how a director can create ""nothing"", but leave it to Mr. Natali and the brilliant individuals at C.O.R.E. to"
23064,What would you do if you were all alone in the world? What would you do if the entire world suddenly disappeared in front of your eyes? What would you do if the entire world suddenly disappeared in front of your eyes?
23065,"Another weird premise from the director of the movie ""Cube""<n>The last half hour of the movie is where things really start to come together... similar in a way to the recent movie ""Primer"""
23066,What would happen if Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams would have worked together on one movie? brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
23067,"Nothing is fantastic! Simple as that! It's a film that shouldn't work, yet does. Natali stays in the realm of Sci-Fi, however this film is also a comedy."
23068,"Sitting, Typing Nothing is the latest ""what if?"" fest offered by Vincenzio Natali, and starring David Hewlitt and Andrew Miller as two losers"
23069,"A very unique concept is brought to the screen in a coherent and well-executed fashion, with a strong script, nice sound design and (fairly) impressive visuals creating a very entertaining movie"
23070,"One of the best films I have seen in ages. It had the audience laughing the whole time. See it if you can. (I particularly liked the ""Candy bar! Candy bar!"" scene.)"
23071,"One of Vincenzo Natali's best, but it's not quite as good as he'd like it to be..."
23072,"Not as good as Cube, but not as bad as the trailer makes it out to be. It's not a horror film, it's an Absurdist comedy."
23073,One of the best movies I've ever seen -- and my son loved it too. We're both cynical/critical personality types and we usually crack on movies while we watch them. We just laughed and enjoyed the film from start to
23074,"One of Vincenzo Natali's better films, but lacks in some areas. brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr"
23075,One of the most interesting movies I've seen in a long time.........
23076,"Nothing is a great movie, but there are a few things that I didn't like about it. I'm not sure what they were trying to accomplish with the post-credits scene."
23077,"One of the better independent films I've seen in a long time, but it's not as good as it could've been...or should've been"

23079,"The best film i've seen in a long time, and i've seen it a few times too......"
23080,"This is a good movie, but it is not recommended if you don't like intelligent movies. It's about two guys that wish that the world would go away,and that's exactly what they get."
23081,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time...and I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once.
23082,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time! I'm a big Vincenzo Natali fan and this is one of his best!
23083,One of the funniest movies I have ever had the chance to watch. Dave and Andrew make a great comedic pair and the humor was catchy enough to remember.
23084,the only word that sums up this movie is quirky. it's a light-hearted romp through an existential concept. bouncy (in more way than one) and a bit nutty
23085,"It's a good movie, it's a bad movie, it's a bad movie, it's a bad movie, it's a bad movie, it's a bad movie, it's a bad movie"
23086,This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time! I can't believe I've seen it so many times! I loved it!

23094,"Gwyneth Paltrow at her best in this version of ""A Man For All Seasons""<n>Sophie Thompson steals the show as Miss Bates in this version of ""A Man For All Seasons"""
23095,"Jane Austen would approve of this one! Gwyneth Paltrow does an awesome job capturing the attitude of Emma. She puts on a very convincing British accent (not being British myself, maybe I'm not the best judge, but she fooled me..."
23096,"Emma is a true romance. If you love the soppy stuff, charged with wit and folly, you will love this movie! Its true to the novel, which is very important, with a few twists added for pleasure."
23097,"A good adaptation of Austen's novel. Good, but not brilliant. The cinematography is inventive, crossing at times the border to gimmickry, but it certainly avoids the trap of making this look like a boring TV soap in costumes."
23098,"Well, I guess I'm emotionally attached to this movie since it's the first one I went to see more than 10 times in the cinema..."
23099,"Jane Austen's ""Emma"" is one of her most delightful and funny novels, thanks to overall irony pervading situations and characters. The movie respected this subtle irony. The cast is really talented and offer very good and extremely brilliant performances"
23100,The best adaptation of this book I've ever seen. I've seen every adaptation of this book and felt this was the best one. I've seen every adaptation of this book and felt this was the best one.

23102,Good production values and solid performances in this straightforward adaption of Jane Austen's satirical classic about the marriage game within and between the classes in provincial 18th Century England
23103,"""Emma"" was a product of what might be called by the First Great Jane Austen Cycle of the mid-nineties, and it was recently shown on British television"
23104,"Gwyneth Paltrow shines in this early showcase for her British accent, and the cast assembled around her all lap up the dialogue. This came out around the time of Sense and Sensibility, and I'm sure I don't know why..."
23105,Not as good as the book but still very entertaining and worth watching.........
23106,"It s like Jane Austen s book, it s a bit boring, but it s a good movie, too!"
23107,One of my favorite movies of all time. I really think the movie is much better. I loved Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma and Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley was an excellent chose.
23108,"""Emma Woodhouse"" Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love, Duets) has nothing to do with herself but painting, going with her friends on her chariot up and down"
23109,"OK adaptation, but not as good as the TV version. The scenery is far too lush. Only Americans would make it like this. Only England has never been like this. Only Americans would make it like this."

23116,"This game was my favorite past time as a developing gamer,and I love it.I found the graphics in the water courses very very very very good.Next to the Bowser world ones,it has the best graphics in the game."

23118,"Super Mario 64 is the greatest video game of all time..but why don't you just get it for yourself?...(I've beaten the game 4 times, but I've never gotten all 120 stars...(I"
23119,Super Mario 64 is one of the best games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. It's just as good as the rest of the games in the series.
23120,Mario's first foray into the world of 3-dimensions is incredible. Miyamoto's masterpiece was reason enough to buy a Nintendo 64 when it was released in 1996 and it still holds all of it's charm today.
23121,"It's a bit easy. That's about it. I got this game as a Christmas present in 1997 and since then, I have dutifully gotten 120 stars over 10 times."
23122,I'm still laughing my ass off at the end of this movie. I'm grateful we're still able to see different stuff from what Hollywood almost floods us with.
23123,One of the best films I've seen in a long time..........
23124,One of the best documentaries ever made about the World Trade Center collapse. The Naudet brothers are to be commended for their work on this film. The Naudets are to achievement in documentary filmmaking.

23130,This is the real deal. I am so glad the footage exists to show people how it was on the day. It is a shame that they didn't use any footage of people jumping from the buildings because friends who were there tell me
23131,"Not as good as I thought it would be, but still a good film. The filmakers were in all the right places at the right times, no other footage from the day matches what they shot."
23132,"The best way to tell history is to tell it in the form of a story, and movies are a good way to do it too..."
23133,"This film stands as a testament to humanity in its darkest hour. You can't change history, and you should not want, this film stands as a testament to humanity in its darkest hour."

23135,"This is the best documentary I have ever seen about 9/11 and the men who put their lives on the line on it's darkest day. Watch if you can,this is the best documentary I have personally ever seen."
23136,Amazing documentary. Saw it on original airdate and on DVD a few times in the last few years. I was shocked that it wasn't even nominated for a Best Documentary Oscar for...
23137,A very good and VERY realistic documentary about the attacks on the WTC.2 French film makers who are in New York to film the actions of a NYFD are being confronted with this event and make the most of it.
23138,"It was set up perfectly, and how they got all of that footage is amazing! The unfortunate events of September 11, 2001 are put together well in this documentary and the classic footage that they got made this an unfortunate classic"
23139,The Finest Piece of Work I Have Seen documenting the 9/11/01 tragedy of New York City. The finest piece of work I have seen documenting the 9/11/01 tragedy of New York City.

23143,"I could see this film is super He didn't surprise to oneself when so that it was taking place for the truth, this way by itself how swigged flight to the which didn't have the place but it is only"
23144,Missing scenes in the DVD version of this movie.. I think the VHS version might have all the missing stuff.. Otherwise I like to know which DVD release has the missing stuff.

23149,A refreshing change from the usual 80's sci-fi/fantasy/action/adventure/comedy/action/adventure/science fiction/fantasy genre films.
23150,"Space Camp is a pretty decent film. The plot is predictable, but the actors do a good job, and the special effects are decent for the time."
23151,"One of those feel good, Saturday afternoon movies. It's right up there with other retro flicks like Flight of the Navigator. And it's fun to see how 20 years has changed the stars like Kelly Preston and Lea Thompson."
23152,SpaceCamp is a fun family film that should be enjoyed for just that - fun. All the'realists' in the world should lighten up or stick to watching documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other type of film
23153,Spacecamp is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It's a great movie for kids and adults of all ages.
23154,"One of the few ""family"" movies that holds your interest. I know that the begining drags, particuarly if you know what is going to happen, but the second half is probably one of the most nerve wracking"
23155,A Space Film that doesn't take itself too seriously and everyone can come along for the exciting ride that is space camp. I would recommend this as a nice night in movie and a 7 Vote
23156,Spacecamp is a movie that I plan to show my Daughter Julia Ann Ruth Morgan some day. Seeing Joaquin Phoenix in this movie makes you realize how far hes come since playing a Roman Emperor in the film Gladiator
23157,Spacecamp is my favorite movie. It is a great story and also inspires others.brbrThe acting was excellent and my wife and I went to see Lea Thompson in Cabaret years later due to her performance in the movie.
23158,One of the best sitcoms I've seen in a long time. Global should have kept it on the air.....
23159,I'm watching this on the Star World network overseas which buys American and Canadian series that last one or two seasons like The Jane Show. I thought of how many female lead comedy shows Im actually able to watch on my own...
23160,Teresa Pavlinek's new TV show is a refreshing idea. It is a fresh idea and hopefully it does well. Too bad this couldn't be paired up with Corner Gas.

23168,"A little quirky, but a good crime film for the first-time viewer.<n>Nicole Kidman proves she's far more than just a beautiful face."
23169,A good example of a film that in spite of the low rating is more than worth watching. The story is engaging and it doesn't take long before the chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin grabs your attention.
23170,"Not as good as I thought it would be, but not as bad as I thought it would be, but not as bad as I thought it would be"
23171,"""Are you a giraffe?... ask John to Nadia, and she, sure of responding well, responds him: yes. ""Birthday Girl"" is a passionate movie that makes me fall in count, at the same time, that Nicole Kidman"
23172,"An odd love story, but a good one to watch if you like the hero John are lonely thirty something something you may find something to identify with in his character."
23173,"One of the better movies I've seen in a long time, but it's not a great movie. It's a bit of a breath of fresh air."
23174,One of the best films I've seen in a long time - and I've seen it in the UK too. I've never seen it in the U.S.

23178,Very good movie : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : 
23179,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and I'm still in love with Nicole Kidman. I can't get enough of her."
23180,Nicole Kidman is a wonderful actress and here she's great. I really liked Ben Chaplin in The Thin Red Line and he is very good here too.
23181,"I've had a lot of experience with women in Russia, and this movie portrays what a lot of them are like, unfortunately. They are very cunning, ruthless, and greedy, as well as highly unfair."
23182,"This is a great little film, that's very unique, and creative, with some great plot twists and wonderful performances!.. Nicole Kidman is simply amazing in this!."
23183,"Good, funny, straightforward story, excellent Nicole Kidman. This was a good ""vehicle"" for someone adept at comedy and drama since there are elements of both."
23184,"I liked the movie. I traveled to Russia 3 different times (adopting our 2 kids). I can't put my finger on exactly why I liked this movie other than seeing ""bad"" turn ""good"" and ""good"" turn"
23185,"Excellent movie, albeit slightly predictable. I have to comment on Nicole Kidmans acting in this movie. Birthday Girl doesn't suffer from this in the slightest. Even without words Kidmans acting shines through."

23188,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time - and I've seen it with a lot more people than I've seen it with."
23189,It could have been very funny (which it is in parts) or quite frightening (which it is in one scene) but the director didn't seem to know which way to go
23190,"""Biarkan Bintang Menari"" (BBM)'s storyline touches the very core of human relationships, especially that of Indonesian people. Despite the fact the film was based on a ""supposedly"" fairytale, it's"
23191,DeMille's early work is superior to DeMille's later work. Ridgely's acting is superb.. a must see.

23195,"The Yanks' version was unwatchable, braindead pap that seem to run forever. A prime example of quantity over ( non-existent ) quality. The original, on the other hand, is a fondly-remembered gem"
23196,"Man about the house is a true situation comedy in every sense of the word. The comedy concerns a character called Robin Tripp (played by the great Richard O' Sullivan) who finds himself after a wild party, ending up at the home of"
23197,One of the best comedies of the 1970's. Also has the best signature tune of any comedy show. The story is about three people sharing a flat living above their landlords George and Mildred. A man and two women.

23208,I watched this movie after seeing it on Broadway. I love the Broadway musical and I love the movie. I watched the movie like it was not related to the Broadway show.

23212,"Barbara Stanwyck's ""To Please A Lady"" and ""Jeopardy"" are two great films on this DVD set! Ralph Meeker steals the show in ""Jeopardy"""
23213,"Good white-knuckler given an electric jolt by Ralph Meeker. He's unusually flippant, reckless actor (at least here and in ""Kiss Me Deadly"") and he happily snatches the keys to the film's narrative"
23214,"Jeopardy is a tense, satisying thriller, a cut above a B but not really a major production. It qualifies as almost an experimental film, as the studio that produced it, Metro, was desperately looking for new kinds of films,"
23215,"A movie that can keep you in suspense even when you have seen it before deserves some sort of special rating, maybe a white knuckles award? I found this movie to be suspenseful almost from the get-go"

23219,"What a great Barbara Stanwyck film that I happened to see the other night. ""Jeopardy"" was fantastic. It was made in 1953 and probably for double bills but it kept me on the edge of my seat."
23220,One of John Sturges' best short movies...........
23221,"The Haunting is a good film, but it could've been a little more intense...... The Haunting could've used a few more scenes of pure terror..."
23222,The Haunting lets go and is certainly not boring. Perhaps this film might appeal more to John Carpenter fans but more of an traditional plot structure. See both and also The Innocents and The Legend of Hell House with Pamela Franklin
23223,"I loved this movie. I don't usually go to Horror movies. I needn't have bothered. ;) (The Cinema was full of kids too, heh! ;)... Liam was great as always."

23225,"Great movie, but some computer generated effects are a bit scary. I didn't go to the movies and see this, but its a scary late night don't feel like going out movie. I would recommend it!"
23226,"It's another Hollywood's horror flick with very high budget(80 million dollars).Not scary at all,it offers us only a few thrills and one really creepy sequence with skeleton in the fireplace.A lot of computer generated special effects"
23227,"What can I say that hasn't been said about ""The Haunting""? It has everything that would make a great picture. The screenplay, though, sometimes boggles the mind in such a weird, surrealistic way."
23228,"Great special effects, but why isn't it on the big screen? I don't understand why people don't like this film. I don't like special effects films."

23243,This is a film for entertainment; I did not think the world made social commentary from one small film. It is a fantasy not unlike a cinder girl becoming a Princess.

23250,"""Hatred of a Minute"" is one of the better films to come out of Michigan in recent years. Not to say that it's a brilliant film by any means, but it's definitely worth a watch."
23251,"Not great, but it has a lot of great elements. The lighting and scenes along with the camera work are great. The story is slow and weak, but entertaining. The acting is bad, but no worse than you will find on the"

23258,"This film deserves more recognition than its getting. It really is a stunning and rich portrayal of blood ties, favours and allegiances within the crime world. The film is shot beautifully and delves into all you're classic crime themes such as betrayal"
23259,"Election is one of the trial society theme movies where not much bloodshed is needed. Johnnie To puts the greed of the human beings in the movie, where bloodshed is commonly used in other trial society theme movies."
23260,"One of the best Hong Kong thrillers of the 1990's, but it feels like it's been a long time since it was released. It's still one of Johnnie To's best."
23261,"Not as violent as Dragon Squad, but still a good watch. I'd recommend this movie to any Triad/Mafia movie fan. Another good watch would be Dragon Squad."
23262,"The Triad elects their leader, but it is far from democratic with the behind the scenes machinations.<n>Good performances by Simon Yam, Louis Koo and Ka Tung Lam (Infernal Affairs I & III), along with Tony Leung Ka"
23263,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time."

23265,"One of Johnnie To's better movies...but not as good as Coppola's ""The Godfather"" or ""Coppola's"" ""The Godfather"""
23266,Great fun to watch if you love crime films of the organized variety. Those looking for a crime film starring a charismatic lead with dreams of taking over in a bad way may be slightly disappointed with the way this film strides.
23267,"One of the best gangster films I've seen in a long time, but it's not as action-oriented as you'd expect. It's romanticized and dark."
23268,"One of the best gangster epics of all time, but not nearly as good as the first one......"

23281,What a good movie! At last a picture revealing a unknown side of rock: illusions of fame. And with a good sense of humour. Have you ever danced on Bill Haley's Rock Around the Clock?

23290,"If you need cheering up on a cold weekday evening, this is the film for you! Excellent script and perfectly cast actors. I especially loved Ray psyching himself up in front of the mirror before gigs - inspired!"
23291,"An affectionate tribute to the 70's, and the people behind Strange Fruit's long, strange reunion.<n> Juliet Aubrey is quite good as the manager of the reunion, and Stephen Rea handles the more dramatic role well without sentimentality."

23303,wonderful movie with good story great humour (some great one-liners) and a soundtrack to die for. i've seen it 3 times so far.
23304,Still Crazy is better written and acted out than Spinal Tap..... Still Crazy is formulaic but the likability of the characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some musical numbers offset the a priori predictability

23387,"If you're looking for action, you should turn away. This is pure psychology. But if you're willing to sit down and devote a good 90 minutes of your life to a novel cinematic experience, by all means, DO IT"

23389,"""Cypher"" is a pretty inventive Sci-Fi thriller that often evokes feelings of fright & claustrophobia despite being utterly implausible. Trust me, it's actually less complicated than it sounds and director Vincenzo Natali carefully takes"

23394,"This movie is a Gem because it moves with soft, but firm resolution.brbrI caution viewers that although it is billed as a Corporate Spy thriller and Ms. Liu is there, it moves at a deftly purposeful yet sedate pace"
23395,I've seen this movie for at least 4 times now and I still don't get bored watching it.brbrThe visuals are so good and together with the music which is totally awesome and perfect fitting this movie is mind

23398,"""Cypher"" is a cleverly conceived story about industrial espionage set in America in the not too distant future. While thematically not complex, this film does offer many different perspectives about personal loyalty, ruthlessness, and corporate conspiracy."
23399,One of the best movies I've ever seen. Actually it's one of the best movies I've ever seen (and that's something I really don't say this about every fifth well-made flick)
23400,"One of the best Sci-Fi movies I've seen in a long time - & it's not a ""B"" movie! It's a surprise!"

23404,"'Grey Gardens'(1975) is the Maysles' brothers bizarre documentary of Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis'eccentric aunt and first cousin who live like pigs in a run down 28 room mansion on East Hampton, Long Island"
23405,"Big Edie and Little Edie are the two crazies that the Mazles Bros. chose to document. They seem like characters out of a Fellini film, only stranger, if that makes any sense"
23406,"Big Edie and Little Edie live in absolute filth, cats, fleas, and filth................ "
23407,Exploitation in the truest sense of the word...........

23413,A must see for anyone interested in Edith Bouvier Beales and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's eccentric life. Superbly directed by Albert and David Maysles.
23414,"Excellent film showing the pathetic lives of two nutty old ladies. They couldn't live together, nor apart. They hashed and re-hashed the past; going on and on about what coulda shoulda shoulda woulda"
23415,One of the best films I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more times than I've seen it. I've seen it more times than I've seen it.
23416,This is a film you will not soon forget. This is a film you will not soon forget. I watched in amazement as Ediths Jr. and Sr. bickered and performed while reminiscing of their past.
23417,Fascinating yet unsettling look at Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie) aunt and first cousin to the late Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis

23423,"A beautiful portrait of stylistic importance and a charm that is highly unlikely to be ever seen again, the way only the Meysels and few others could do"
23424,"""Big Edie"" and ""Little Edie"" could be considered the ""skeletons"" in the family closet. They certainly could be considered the ""skeletons"" in the family closet."
23425,"What a glorious past it was. Edith and Edie are women living in the past, and oh what a glorious past it was. Edith was really quite beautiful and you can see the shadow of her beauty still as she sings ""Tea for Two"
23426,"One of the best love stories I have ever seen. It is a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion, but lovely nonetheless... Big Edie and Little Edie seem a bit like family members after watching this movie repeatedly, and are infinitely"

23431,Don't take it as mindless humor because it is so much more than that. You just need to read into some of her material a bit more to get it.
23432,"I've been waiting for Sarah's show to turn it around, but I've struggled a bit with her humor of late and a thin 7 is what's settled in"

23435,"Sarah Silverman is a dangerous Bitch! She's beautiful, sexy, funny and talent, dark and demonic. I read the other 'comment' on this show as well as the message board stuff and people just don't get"
23436,"Big S isn't playing with taboos or forcing an agenda like Mencia or Chapelle (though I like them both). Her show won't change the World, nor is it meant to."

23438,"I'm a huge Sarah Silverman fan, but I'm not a huge fan of the pilot. I'm a huge Sarah Silverman fan. I'm a huge Sarah Silverman fan. I'm a huge Sarah Silverman fan."
23439,"One of the best sitcoms of all time, and one of the best originals ever made..............."
23440,"It's not perfect, but it's a good show. It's not perfect, but it's a good show. It's not perfect, but it's a good show."
23441,"One of the greatest cult comedies since the cancelled ""Strangers With Candy""<n>One of the most unconventional, non-stereotypical portrayals of a gay couple I have ever seen on television"
23442,"Best show since Seinfeld. She's really really funny. Her total self centeredness, the hulking gay stoner neighbors, the departures into song or cartoons, make this the freshest show on TV."
23443,"The Sarah Silverman program is... better than those other shows. No laugh tracks, no painful jokes, just a program. If you're like me, and you love comedy, this is probably a show for you."
23444,"It's not a laugh out loud sort of comedy, but that's good thing, too much has a-track to it, and this wouldn't be right with cues when to laugh"
23445,"The worst show I've seen in a long, long time.................."
23446,"Sarah Silverman's True Colors shine in this Comedy Central gem. I could possibly put her on par with the likes of Amy Sedaris in Strangers with Candy -- Sarah's character is a true sociopath, very comparable to Sedaris'"
23447,One of the best kung fu movies I've seen in a long time.. and one of the best I've seen in a long time..
23448,The Five Deadly Venoms is a great kung-fu action movie wrapped in a whodunnit mystery. It's interesting and holds your attention throughout the non-fight scenes.
23449,One of the best martial arts movies I've ever seen..and it's not just for the martial arts fans..it's for the whole family.
23450,"One of the best kung fu films of all time, but could have been even better........"
23451,One of the best Kong Kong films I've seen in a long time -- and it's not just because it's a Kong Kong Kong film.
23452,"One hell of a fun movie, but the story drags a bit in the first half up until the first fight sequence. But stick with it, and you won't be disappointed!"
23453,One of the best martial arts movies ever made. A CLASSIC!! A fine film in its own right and quite possible one of the best martial arts movies ever made.
23454,"One of the best kung-fu movies of all-time, but don't expect it to live up to it's gauntlet of other films!"
23455,One of the best kung-fu films of the 70's and 80's. Very well made with a unique story. Very well made with a unique story.
23456,"One of the best kung-fu movies of the 90's, a real man's kung-fu movie....."
23457,"One of the best old-school kung fu movies of all time, if not ever......."
23458,"One of the best martial arts movies of the '70s and '80s is coming out on DVD. It's now available from Dragon Dynasty and the print is beautiful and the DVD commentary by Bey Logan is EXACTLY the kind of intelligent, thoughtful"
23459,One of the best martial arts films I've seen in a long time.........
23460,One of the best kung-fu films I've seen in a long time. A must see for anyone who loves the Shaw Brothers and Venoms.
23461,"If you love kung-fu films and you haven't seen this movie, you are cheating yourself. This movie is one of the only kung-fu cheapies that could be recommended for fans of all types of film."
23462,I really like this movie. I can watch it on a regular basis and not tire of it. I suppose that is one of my criteria for a great movie
23463,"""Pick Your Poison"" is the best kung fu movie I've ever seen, and it's available on DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
23464,Five Venoms is one of the best kung-fu movies I've seen in a long time......
23465,One of the best kung fu movies i have ever seen.I loved it the minute it came on.The plot was hard to follow at that age but it was the fighting.The fights were so...amazing.I moaned every time
23466,Not as good as I thought it would be but not as bad as I thought it would be......
23467,This is the best Kung Fu movie I've ever seen! I wish I could see it again! I can't believe where I've found it!
23468,Five Deadly Venoms is one of the best chop socky movies ever made. But it's not as bloody and violent as Story Of Ricky or Super Ninjas.
23469,"One of the best K.F. movies of all time, and one of the best movies of all time, from the Shaw Brothers' stable, and one of my all-time favorites!!!"
23470,"The Five Venoms - Celestial Region 3 DVD - A must have for any Kung Fu fan. Good but not great. Golden Swallow, by the same director a decade earlier, had as good a story and better action."
23471,"Powell and Arthur's comic banter is the highlight of this murder mystery. Powell is probably the most suave detective of the 30's, and Arthur has a unique voice which often sounds like a succession of tiny tinkly bells."
23472,"One of Powell's better roles in a long time, but it's not as good as The Thin Man, but it's still good."
23473,Powell and Arthur's chemistry makes up for Thin Man's lack of wit........
23474,"Powell, Arthur, Blore, Gleason, and Loy in ""The Ex-Mrs. Bradford""<n>""The Ex-Mrs. Bradford"" is Powell's ""Thin Man"""
23475,"""The Ex-Mrs. Bradford"" is one of the most entertaining of the dozens and dozens of mystery-comedy ""who-done-its"" of the '30s & 40s"
23476,"Enjoyed this 1936 film with plenty of veteran classic actors and especially, William Powell, (Dr. Lawrence Bradford), ""Mister Roberts"", who played the role as a doctor and detective."
23477,"An art movie in whatever meaning that phrase has to offer. Not for spending free time, but for watching an artwork with the necessary concentration as in reading a book or attending a concert."
23478,"""The Suspended Step of the Stork"" implicitly demands a close and intimate participation on the part of the viewer. Angelopoulos' genius through Arvanitis' camera is on display throughout the film."
23479,"Heart-breaking, disturbing, and inspiring all in one. I recommend this documentary to anyone seeking something that will make them think about what they are doing with their own lives. Or simply, something that will make you think."
23480,"I fell in love with Jonni Kennedy. He had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality. I cried, watched some more, laughed, got up to get another Kleenex, then cried some more."
23481,I agree with other comments - this should be compulsory viewing in schools. He took everything that life could throw at him and still managed to retain a sense of humour. God Bless. I couldn't watch the part that showed his dressings being
23482,"An uplifting, confounding and provocatively humorous story of a singular man. Not shy away from the grim reality of EB, the film was also a celebration of a life lived to the full."
23483,"The most moving and truly eye opening documentary ever created. I cried the whole way through, from start to end. (DEBRA)Jonny is one of the only people that deserves true respect and admiration, he is the definition of a"
23484,"This man is nothing short of amazing. You truly feel as if you have lived his life with him throughout these tragic events, and cry along with his family in the end."
23485,the best movie i've seen in a long time.thank you jonny for sharing such hope and faith with me.thank you jonny
23486,"The best documentary I have seen in a very long time. Jonny Kennedy was and is still is a tragically beautiful inspiration. Not only was he a survivor of one of the most painful diseases out there, but he used his beauty to show the"
23487,"This was a must see documentary for me when I missed the opportunity in 2004. I really sympathised with the main character of the film, because, I have a milder condition of the skin problem he had, Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa"
23488,I laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt. Ben Affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a pretty boy Jack Black in this role. Gandolfini gives his typical A performance.
23489,"Not as bad as I heard. It was enjoyable, funny and I love that is revolves around the holiday season. It totally has me in the mood to Christmas shop and listen to holiday music."
23490,"What would you expect from a film titled 'Surviving Christmas' and presented as 'festive fun'? Well, I got what I wanted and I'm glad I did!"
23491,"The best Christmas movie i've seen in a long time, and i'm not just saying that because it's Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Christina Appelagate, and Catherine O' Hara"
23492,Surviving Christmas is a surprisingly funny movie especially considering the bad publicity when it was first released. Ben Affleck is funny as an obnoxious millionaire who pays the family that occupies his childhood home to be his family for Christmas.
23493,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. James Gandofini is the real star of this one....
23494,A wonderful movie that I will be adding to my Christmas selection. The cast was wonderfully chosen and Ben Affleck plays a good leading role. I would tell viewers who have not seen the movie to go ahead and buy it.
23495,What's not to like about this movie? What's not to like about this movie? What's not to like about this movie? What's not to like about this movie?
23496,"You can survive Surviving Christmas. I thought the television version was a bit edited way down. I like Ben Afleck. He plays Drew Johnson, a family-less adult, who is willing to pay complete strangers."
23497,"This movie is better than 4. I can see this happening...wealthy people have done crazier things than this. And it was funny.brbrI watch a comedy to be entertained, escape from the pressures of the world for"
23498,What's with all the negative comments? I can only say that this is a good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely person's day
23499,"One of those little Christmas movies for everyone. This is a great little high school soap, PG-13, but the small sex references are comedy, so if your kid can't handle them, they can't live in the real world"
23500,A low budget slasher film with a good plot and a good cast. It's not great but not bad at all. I give it a 7. Molly Ringwald is obligatory in this having the time of her life playing a bitchy
23501,"One of the better neo-slasher flicks of the '90s, if you're a fan of the '80s genre...."
23502,"One of the better ""Scream"" rip-offs, even if it's not the best slasher flick ever....."
23503,"""Cut"" is actually better than a lot of slashers.it's just not as good as ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Friday the 13th"""
23504,"This is a surprisingly above average slasher, that's enjoyable,and well made, with some decent gore, and I say it's well worth the watch!."
23505,"This is not a bad movie. It follows the new conventions of modern horror, that is the movie within a movie, the well known actress running for her life in the first scene. This movie takes the old convention of a psycho killer on"
23506,"""Cut"" achieves what it sets out to do. Most of the standard slasher cliches are there. Most of the couple interrupted by the killer while they're having sex (that's hardly a spoiler)"
23507,"It's not the worst, it's not the best, it's not the worst, it's not the best, it's not the worst"
23508,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time, and it's not just because it stars Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman."
23509,"One of the best films of the '60s, but it's not all it's cracked up to be...."
23510,"I'm 82-years-old, but I've seen this movie more than once........."
23511,One of the greatest films of all time--and it's still relevant today.......
23512,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I'm not surprised anymore. It was way ahead of its time in regards to its style, cinematography, and use of flashback to help develop Joe Buck's character"
23513,"Jon Voight is brilliant in Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, though reminiscent of his later turn in Rainman, is the kind of performance that keeps me watching movies."
23514,"""I'm walkin' here! I'm walkin' here! I'm walkin' here! I'm walkin' here!"""
23515,One of the best films I've seen in a long time..and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time..and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
23516,"I love MIDNIGHT COWBOY and have it in my video collection as it is a favorite of mine. What is interesting to me is how when MIDNIGHT COWBOY came out in 1969, it was so shocking to viewers that it was"
23517,The Sopranos is America's most original and compelling drama. Forget Family Redifined. This is Television Redifined. This is Television Redifined.
23518,"""The Sopranos"" has redefined television as we know it. It has broken all rules, and set new standards for television excellence. Everything is flawless, the writing, directing, and for me, most of all, the acting."
23519,The Sopranos - Television Show of All Time brbr br br br br br br br br br br br
23520,The Sopranos is one of the best TV shows ever! It has the same quality as GodFather! James Gandolfini fits at the paper as a glove! I would love The Sopranos would never finish at all.
23521,One of the best TV shows I've seen in a long time. I've watched it over and over. I've watched it over and over. I've watched it over and over.
23522,One of Gandolfini's best performances in a long time. I can't wait to see him in other movies where he delivers a totally different role. Can u recommend me some of his older movies where he gives a memorable performance
23523,"One of the best TV series of all time, and one of the best of all time, and one of the best of all time, and one of the best of all time."
23524,"The Sopranos is one of the best TV dramas of all time. The Sopranos is the Godfather of TV. So the Sopranos is definitely the Godfather, Goodfellas and Pulp Fiction of TV."
23525,"The ""gangster"" genre is now a worn subject one that is too often subjected to parody. Thankfully the writers have advanced upon this flaw by creating a realism which has been applied to it."
23526,"""The Sopranos"" is one of the best television shows I've seen in a long time...and it's not just because James Gandolfini plays Tony Soprano."
23527,"""The Sopranos"" is one of the greatest TV shows of all time, and one of the best series ever made. The best of all time."
23528,The best episode of The Sopranos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
23529,How could any actor fail with these characters? How could any actor fail with these characters? How could any actor fail with these characters? How could any actor fail with these characters?
23530,"The Sopranos is one of the best TV series of all time, and one of the best movies of all time, and one of the best of all time."
23531,"THE SOPRANOS, THE GODFATHER, THE GODFATHER, THE GODFATHER, THE SOPRANOS, THE SOPRANOS, THE SOPRANOS, THE SOPRANOS, THE SOPRANOS, THE SOPRAN"
23532,The most mind-opening show I've seen in a long time - and I'm not just talking about the plot. I'm talking about the characters.
23533,"A great show, but some critics are wrong about the Italian-American characters. They're not as stupid as some of you make them out to be."
23534,"The Sopranos stands out as an airtight, dynamic exploration of American life, and how the American experience is shaped and defined by money. David Chase eliminates all barriers to a grunt, low to the ground and outright mean deconstruction of the post"
23535,One of the best TV shows of all time! I can't believe I've been able to watch it over and over and over and over again!
23536,"The Sopranos (now preparing to end) is the very peak of adult television and drama. When The Sopranos hits the mark, it really hits the mark."
23537,"The Sopranos is the greatest TV show of all time, and it's not just because it's the best. It's because it's the best."
23538,"""The Sopranos"" takes another tack. No suited up, classy mobsters here with homes in Lake Tahoe and stakes in Vegas casinos - these guys are goombahs, with a front of waste management, who deal with things that"
23539,"If you've never watched this show, you're in for an extended treat. If you've never watched this show, you're in for an extended treat."
23540,"""The Godfather"" and ""The Sopranos"" aren't the same show, but they're nothing alike. The Sopranos is better."
23541,"The Sopranos is the best T.V show i've ever seen, and i'm not just talking about the first season. It's the only T.V show i've ever watched."
23542,"the sopranos was the best show to air in the 90's. its sad that its over, its was the best show on HBO if not on TV"
23543,This is my favorite show. Thanks to David Chase for bringing this into my life.brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
23544,"Chase has created a true phenomenon with The Sopranos. Unfaltering performances, rock-solid writing, and some great music make up what has become quite possibly the best show ever."
23545,Brendan Filone is the best character on The Sopranos. he died by getting shot in the eye. This was the best and well orchestrated scene ever in the Sopranos.
23546,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time........."
23547,One of the best action films I've seen in a long time - and it's not just because of Roy Schieder's acting. It's because of John Glover's acting.
23548,One of Frankenheimer's best films! Robert Trebor's best performance in a long time! Don't forget about this film! A classic exploitive thriller that shouldn't be forgotten!
23549,"One of Frankenheimer's best and most underrated films. It's easily the best Elmore Leonard adaptation to date (and if you are scratching your head thinking ""but I loved GET SHORTY"" you need to be punched in the face"
23550,"One of the best Elmore Leonard movies I've seen in a long time. I've never read the book, but it feels like I'm watching an Elmore Leonard movie."
23551,One of the best action movies I've seen in a long time. It's a must-see for anyone who likes action movies and drama.
23552,"One of the best noirs I've seen in a long time, but it's not quite as good as I'd like it to be"
23553,"Roy Scheider, Kelly Preston, John Glover, Ann-Margret, Vanity, Lonny Chapman, and Lonny Chapman all shine in this taut thriller."
23554,This film made John Glover a star. Alan Raimy is one of the most compelling character that I have ever seen on film. And I mean that sport
23555,A pretty good movie until the end. Ending is the ending we would like to see but not the ending to such a mean beginning. Guess you can make up your own mind about the true ending.
23556,This is a documentary of a fox family.It's not fake.It's real.It's dark and ugly.It serves a purpose.
23557,This movie made me cry for hours. It was a good movie...I think - I was really little and truth be told - all I remember is being happy for the foxes and then seeing one of them die.

23562,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time........."
23563,"This movie is different from Snatch. It was done wonderfully, the cinematography is beautiful, and you can recognize Guy Ritchie's personal touch (style of directing) in it. What won me over was the complexity of the protagonist and how"

23568,One of the best films i've seen in a long time.<n>Guy Ritchie is one of the best directors i've seen in a long time.
23569,"It's an ambitious film, but it bites off more than it can chew. Not worth starting a new religion over, but I'm surprised it didn't get a US distributor. Maybe they found Ray Liotta's intentionally"
23570,One of the best films i've seen in a long time.........
23571,"it's all very simple. Jake goes to prison, and spends five years with the con and the chess masters. they get compassionate about his history of loss and failure, and utterly misery that he lives on because of his belief in..."

23573,One of the best films I have seen in a long time...and it's not just because it's a Guy Ritchie film...it's because it's a Guy Ritchie film!

23575,"One of the best movies I've seen since Lock, Stock, &amp; Snatch. It's one of Guy Ritchie's best."
23576,I still don't know whether i liked it or not. So was the case with most of the reviewers. But none the less i still feel that the movie is worth a 7 for the amount of efforts put in.
23577,One of the best sex farces I've seen in a long time........
23578,One of the best comedy/dramas I've seen in a long time...and it's not just because of the actors...it's because of the script!
23579,"I'll Take You There is a sweet little indie comedy with a little bit of romance in it, but it's not a romantic comedy at all."

23584,"""I'll See You There"" is a great indie-film that doesn't stoop to postmodern irony when dealing with the woes of love and the reality of human emotion."
23585,the first quality romantic-comedy i have ever seen. it had depth and although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together there was still longing and anticipation.
23586,"One of the best TV shows I've ever seen. The actors were very credible. Alexandra Bastedo was just gorgeous. They didn't have super-powers. They just had superior human skills (strength, hearing, sight."
23587,"A favourite of mine when I was a youngster. Stuart Damon and William Gaunt had an unmistakable on-screen chemistry as Craig Stirling and Richard Barrett, while the luscious Alexandra Bastedo pouted her way through her role as Sharron Macready"
23588,"Sharon Mcreedy, Richard Barrat and Craig &amp; Trymane are Super in every way, I wish I could be one of them.."
23589,One of the best TV shows I've ever seen -- and I've seen it more than once. I'd love to see it again.
23590,One of the best sci-fi shows I have ever seen..........
23591,"One of the best series I've ever seen, but I'm still waiting for ""Dr. Who"", ""The Campions"", ""The Tomorrow People"", ""The Worst Witch"""
23592,"""Maléfique"" is an example of how a horror film can be effective with nothing more than a well-executed plot and a lot of heart."
23593,"Well, magic works in mysterious ways. This movie about 4 prisoners, trying to escape with the help of spells, written by another prisoner centuries ago was a superb occult thriller with a surprising end and lots of suspense."
23594,"Malefique is a film about being trapped, or what ultimately happens to Pquerette, or what ultimately happens to Pquerette, or what ultimately happens to Pquerette, or what ultimately happens to Pquer"
23595,"Not as clever as it seemed to think it was but enjoyed it nonetheless. It is original, although reminded me a little of two other French films, Vidocq and City of Lost Children, mostly for the colouring but also for the edgy"
23596,One of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time. I'd give it 5 stars if I could.....
23597,One of the most interesting movies I've seen in a long time.........
23598,One of the best French horror films of the last few years - and one of the best of it's generation! A must see for any horror fan!
23599,"""Maléfique"" is a dark film, with truckloads of claustrophobic tension and several twisted details about human behavior. Watch it before some wealthy American production company decides to remake it with four handsome teenage actors in the unconvincing roles of hard"
23600,Malefique is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I'll keep my eyes open for other movies from director Valette.
23601,"""Maléfique"" is an original, intriguing and claustrophobic French low-budget horror movie. The story is practically in the same location, does not have any clichés and hooks the viewer until the last scene."
23602,One of the best films I've seen in a long time..and one of the best films I've seen in a long time..and one of the best films I've seen in a long time..
23603,"A good low-budget horror film, with a good story, but a little slow to get going. Not a lot of gore, but that wouldn't fit the story, although the gore it has is pretty good."
23604,A nice low-budget French horror movie with occult/supernatural undertones.........
23605,"One of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time! I've seen it more than once, and it's still haunted me!"
23606,"This is a movie that works best if you are immersed into it. Lessons to be learned: Yog is bad, almost as bad as French women. This is a movie that works best if you are immersed into it."
23607,"Malefique is one of the creepiest and most intelligent horror films I have seen this year.The film has a grimy,shadowy feel influenced by the works of H.P. Lovecraft,which makes for a very creepy and unsettling"
23608,One of the best films I've seen in a long time..........
23609,"Maléfique is a great flick, made with just a few bucks but also tons of imagination. Well, I'm a bit exaggerating, but nevertheless I'm sincere."
23610,"One of the best action movies I've ever seen in a long time, and one of Stallone's best efforts. Renny Harlin's best effort."
23611,"""Cliffhanger"" is definitely Stallone's best action adventure movie, with breathtaking shots, vertiginous scenery, dizzying heights, perilous climbs, freezing temperatures"
23612,One of the best action films of the 90's. Stallone is rarely this interesting in his action films. This was one of the best action films of the year and one of the most thrilling and enjoyable of the 90's.
23613,"I'll take Stallone as my action hero any day of the week, because he's one of the few stars I've ever seen who's completely convincing as someone who can withstand a lot of physical and emotional pain."
23614,"Not as bad as I thought it would be, but not as good as I thought it would be......"
23615,One of Renny Harlin's Best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
23616,"One of the best action movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it countless times and I never get tired of it. The setting has a lot to do with it, but the storyline is original and I liked"
23617,Don't take this movie seriously at all - it's just a dumb action-comedy. brbr br br br br br br br 
23618,Cliffhanger is a decent action crime adventure with some flaws from director Renny Harlin whose admirable in making this movie about an expert climber who finds himself taken hostage with a fellow friend by a gang of dangerous criminals on the search for suit cases
23619,One of the best action movies I've seen in a very long time! I've seen it over and over and over and over and over!
23620,One of the best Die Hard movies of all time...........
23621,"""It's the kind of movie you can sit back and enjoy as long as you don't make the mistake thinking too much"" - Roger Ebert"
23622,One of the best Die Hards of the 90s... and it's not just because it's a 'Die Hard on a.....' movie!
23623,"One of the best action films of the 1990's. Stallone, Lithgow, Rooker and Turner make a great trio. DVD is a must for Stallone fans."
23624,Stallone's last action movie before he became an underrated actor. Cliffhanger is what appears to be Slyvester Stallone's last action movie before he became such an underrated actor.
23625,Cliffhanger is one of the best movies of all time!Stallone is the best!Michael Rooker is the best!John Lithgow is great!
23626,A great action movie with a great plot.But a weak script and unrealistic shooting sequences.Sylvester Stallone's character should have been more human.
23627,"Good action, but nothing new. This one took place high in the mountains, which showed some nice scenery and such. One man takes on a group of mercenaries, the lead flies, and he kicks butt"
23628,"Snowy mountain is very good place for action movie and who is better to direct movie where is snow, ice, cold and bad weather than finnish man. Action is good!"
23629,"I enjoyed watching Cliffhanger, at the beginning when that woman (Sarah) was full of terror when she was slipping, i thought that was a terrifying scene as i would think that..."
23630,"Well-crafted, well-acted, well-acted, well-acted, well-acted, well-acted, well-acted, well-acted, well-acted, well-acted, well-acted, well-acted,"
23631,An interesting look at the training regimens and equipment used by Japanese soldiers during World War II. A good source of the state of the American mindset in 1943 as the war waged with Japan.
23632,"One of the most schizophrenic of war films. Stylistically, Bombardier is one of the most schizophrenic of war films. Though it can't help but seem dated today, Bombardier remains an entertaining propaganda effort."
23633,"One of the best sci-fi movies I've seen in a long time, and it's not just because it's a clone of The Matrix"
23634,"One of the most imaginative ""escape"" scenes in recent years. This film also included one of the most imaginative ""escape"" scenes in recent years. The efforts of the director and the actors combined in an effective thriller."
23635,An awesome example of what to do if you don't have a large budget. It had just the right amount of plot and dialog to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark.
23636,"An excellent show! I had a US history teacher in high school that was much like this. There are many ""facts"" in history that are not quite true and Mr. Wuhl points them out very well, in a way that is"
23637,A pretty good example of early 70's exploit sleaze - but still a little slow and un-explicit for my taste...
23638,Exploitation master Joseph W.Sarno's masterpiece!Marie Forsa is one of the hottest chicks I have ever seen in a horror movie-it's a visual pleasure to see her wonderful body!
23639,"A little hard to follow the first time, but that's only because of all the bare breasted '70s painted-up vampire/witches dancing to the bongo drums"
23640,"If you are looking for a great mind control movie, this is it. No movie has had so many gorgeous women under mind control, and naked. Marie Forsa, as the busty Helga, is under just about everytime she falls asleep"
23641,Classic 70's sex trash! The Swedish gal (Helga) was what made this movie so great. She exuded massive quantities of sexuality throughout the film.
23642,"Good, but not as sexy as today's triple X romps, but it's still a good movie. I give it 7 STARS."
23643,"The best of the novels of John Le Carre, exquisitely transformed into a classic film. Performances by Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, Magnus"
23644,My favourite Le Carre novel and it is transformed to the silver screen with all the love and care one could wish for. I read a review that seems to find the characters loathsome but I believe this misses the point.
23645,One of the best spy-thrillers I've seen in a long time. brbrbrbrThe British view of Americans is vividly rendered in some dryly hilarious scenes. brbrbr
23646,"An extremely long movie, but it's worth it for its heart-wrenching plot. I really enjoyed it in the end. Well worth it for people who like inciteful movies about baser human character."
23647,One of the best spy films I've seen in a long time - and it's not just because it's Le Carre's.
23648,A fine cross between a spy thriller and a human drama..........
23649,"One of the best Le Carré minis of all time, and one of the best spy minis of all time, as well as a classic!"
23650,Very well done but not quite as good as Tinker Tailor - The Man Who Knew Too Much.......
23651,"Illudere (to delude) comes from Latin verb 'ludere' (to play), so you're warned about the'spy game' as a cruel and yet elaborate and intelligent..."
23652,"One of the best movies I've ever seen, and one of the best movies I've ever seen. I've seen it many times."
23653,If you want to be a star you need to see this film more than once........
23654,"""Breaking Glass"" is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I can't wait for it to be on DVD."
23655,"One of my best films ever, maybe because i was well into the punk scene in the late 70s and went to many of hazels concerts, but the film was a good story line and very good acting by hazel and a up and"
23656,"One of the best 80's movies I've ever seen..the music stands up to the test of time, Hazel/Kate had something to say about 80's Britain..the same decade I moved to Canada for some of the"
23657,"A must-see for anyone interested in British music trends of the late-seventies, and a must-see for anyone not familiar with the era."
23658,"The soundtrack to this film just has me in tears, especially the ""Will You"" track. It's a pure nostalgia trip for me back to my youth. This rates second best to Quadrophenia (which also starred Phil Daniels)"
23659,O'Connor's voice sounds a lot like Mini Mouse! She disappeared from sight soon after making this movie - so life imitated art! A must see if you want to see a punk version of a Star Is Born though
23660,"One of the best Star Trek fan productions of all time, though it's not quite as good as some of the other fan productions. But it's still worth a shot."
23661,"Hidden Frontier is a fan made show, in the world of Star Trek. The story takes place after Voyager has returned from the Delta-quadrant.<n>It has some characters from the official Star Trek shows, but most of them are"
23662,"Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is a must watch for fans of the series. The production quality is extremely high for a fan film, although sometimes you can tell that they're green-screenin' it. This doesn't take away"
23663,Hidden Frontier is probably the Star Trek fan film with the most episodes produced to date. Over 7 seasons (this is the last) they have produced some 50 or so episodes.
23664,"""Never give up, never surender! Never give up, never surender! Never give up, never surender! Never give up, never surender!"""
23665,"This is a brilliant and well made contribution by a group of fans, and considering it's made in a back bedroom on a painted green screen it's story lines are complex and twisting, and it's characters show realistic depth and"
23666,"Hidden Frontier is one of the best TOS-based series of all time, and it's coming to an end soon. I wish I could give it a rating higher than 10, but it will have to suffice."
23667,"Hidden Frontier will live on for a long time, as long as people enjoy the show, and the story lines, and the cast, and it shows on-screen."
23668,Star Trek Hidden Frontier is one of the best fan fiction films i have seen in a long time and i cant wait for more episodes to come out.
23669,Hidden Frontier is one of the best Trek series and movies of all time! A must-see for Trek fans and non-Trek fans alike! A must-see for any Trek fan!
23670,"Good stuff for a fan series, but needs some work on the green screen........"
23671,"Star Trek: Hidden Frontier - A Fan-Based Production - A League of Its Own. For sheer volume, I don't think this has been matched."
23672,Hidden Frontiers is a great series for Star Trek fans and non-Star Trek fans alike. Hidden Frontiers is a great way to keep the world of Star Trek alive and growing.
23673,Hidden Frontier is a total guilty pleasure in every sense of the word but you have to give the people involved credit where credit is due. It takes a lot of effort to put on a production of this magnitude.
23674,What a surprisingly good movie this one turned out to be. This is the type of film that I've been looking for ages. Particularly important for me...
23675,"Not as good as I expected, but still worth watching for the acting and the film itself. The story is mediocre at best, but the acting is great."
23676,Tommy JOnes and Matt Dillon do the gambling world proud. The various moves with the wrists had to be learned as throwing craps is a skill in and of itself.
23677,"Very entertaining, and a great cast as noted. I'd like to add that Bruce Dern did a fine job also, as is usually the case. Worth renting if you can find it, which has proved difficult for me."
23678,"good story and some memorable lines, well acted and well cast. tommy lee jones and bruce dern make you hate them with passion."
23679,"One of the best anime series I've ever seen, and it's still growing on me. brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr"
23680,"One of Gainax's best, but it's not quite as good as it could have been....."
23681,"One of the best animes I've seen in a long, long time. One of the best animes I've seen in a long, long time. One of the best animes I've seen in a long,"
23682,"Gunbuster is one of my favorite animes of all time. Considering when it was made, the animation is of superior quality. There are no loops and sequences in which the art decreases in quality."
23683,One of the best sci-fi series I've ever seen..but the ending could have been better..and it's not a classic.
23684,The Walking Tall is a great movie and the real Buford Pusser was a great man and a true hero. I wish he was alive today. I wish he were alive today.
23685,One of the best anti-hero movies I've seen in a long time.<n>A great story about courage to stand up and do something about a system that's only serving its own interest.
23686,Just as interesting as the previous one except that there is no suspense. We know what he is going to do and what is going to happen before it is even hinted at on the screen.
23687,This was an actual true story but I can't give it 10 weasel stars since there was no name actress in this picture. Since there was real no name actress in this picture I can't give it 10 weasel stars but I can
23688,"An interesting look at how close some animals are to humans, how they feel the same emotions we do, and yet how we really can't treat them just like people because they aren't"
23689,"Buddy, the gorilla, and Trudy Lintz, the woman who raised him, are the real stars of this film. A must-see for animal lovers."
23690,"Buddy is an entertaining family film set in a time when ""humanizing"" animals, and making them cute was an accepted way to get people to be interested in them."
23691,"I remember these shows when they were first broadcast on Disneyland. I remember sitting there, electrified by Werner Van Braune's explanations of rocket science. I watched as history, science and humor were all interwoven in an engrossing story of possibilities."
23692,"A must-see for any Disney fan, even if you haven't seen it in a long time. *sigh* Most recommended. *sigh* This documentary was nominated for an Oscar and it's easy to see why"
23693,I have not seen this movie! At least not in its entirety. I have seen a few haunting clips which have left me gagging to see it all.
23694,"This movie does a great job of explaining the problems that we faced and the fears that we had before we put man into space. As a history of space flight, it is still used today in classrooms that can get one of the rare prints"
23695,"The use of objects, form editing, the position of characters in the scene... these were all used with such joyous abandon by Hitchcock that you can really see what a fertile genius he had."
23696,"One of Hitchcock's better films, but it's not as good as The Lodger.<n>The Ring deserves more recognition than the inferior but better known The Lodger."
23697,One of the greatest movies of all time - and it's not just because it's a love story. It's because it's Hitchcock!
23698,"One of Hitchcock's best early films, but it's not as good as he'd like it to be...."
23699,"One of Hitchcock's best, if not the best, boxing films of the late 60's........"
23700,"The Ring is one of the best Hitchcock films I've ever seen, and it's not just because it's a Hitchcock film. It's because it's a Hitchcock film."
23701,One of Hitchcock's Early Visually Provocative Films.<n>A Must for Anyone interested in Hitchcock's Development as a Visual storyteller.
23702,"Hitchcock's silent love triangle meets Hitchcock's The Manxman in a very stylish, well-paced, well-photographed, well-acted film."
23703,"Hitchcock's 'One-Round' is a good boxing film, but it's a bit predictable......"
23704,"""The Ring"" has many meanings - the boxing ring, where differences and grievances are fought out, a wedding ring, where Mabel feels trapped and Jack feels his troubles will be over and the cause of the trouble, a ring-like bracelet"
23705,"One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long, long time. Hilarious......."
23706,"Pia gets naked a lot and seems miscast as a writer. Watching her talk about Pushkin and Byron with a guy three times her age is flat unbelievable. I'm sure Pia's a nice person in real life, she just doesn"

23710,Pet Sematary is a very good horror film and believe it or not somebody can make a good horror film out of a Stephen King novel. Mary Lambert does a great job with this film and manages to bring across King's creepy story pretty

23717,One of the best films based on a book I've ever seen - and one of the best movies I've ever seen in a long time.
23718,"This is one of the creepiest, scariest and most heartbreaking horror movies EVER! brbrThe most HEARTBREAKING scene in any horror movie will leave with your Jaw on floor or Shivers will go down your back when you hear"
23719,"""Sometimes, dead is better...for now. Not so much the mortally injured jogger...but the trip into the ""other"" cemetery beyond the pet cemetery."""
23720,"""Pet Sematary"" succeeds on two major situations. First, it's a scary Horror movie. Second, it's an emotional, clever movie overall."
23721,"One of the cruelest horror films in recent memory, but it's still worth watching. Pet Sematary' may actually be one of the cruelest horror films in recent memory, with its murderous zombie baby and its insanely insensitive"

23725,"The most accurate Stephen King adaptation yet. Not surprising, since King himself wrote the screenplay. The story follows the Creed family moving into a beautiful Maine house. One of the other residents is Jud, a pleasant old man who knows a few things"
23726,"This movie was really good, just TOO predictable. And what horror movie doesn't have stupid people? This one is overcrowded with retarded victims just practically begging for their life to be taken."

23728,This movie was excellent for its time and will be interesting for many more generations to come. Although the plot is not 100% accurate to the book most everything is correct. The movie does skip far ahead and does miss some important parts.
23729,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time, and it keeps ringing in my head: sometimes dead is better!          "
23730,this is not the best movie of all time but i still recommend it to anyone who wants to watch a good horror flick. i don't think that people who don't like this movie are wrong.

23738,"A very funny movie! I have no idea whether it translates well into other languages or not. However, I do think men all over the world can identify with ""Frank"" and his thoughts to some extent!"
23739,"""Vuxna mnniskor"" (Adult People) is the greatest Swedish movie of all time. Not only is it revolutionary in its narration, but its also among the first movies to feature the next generation of Swedish humor and"

23741,"One of the best horror films of the late 60's and 70's, but under-rated......"
23742,"One of two genres where logic doesn't always win out over imagination. We all know that killers like Freddy, Jason, Michael and even Leatherface shouldn't be able to sustain the amount of pain they do and still live to fight"
23743,"One of the better reality shows I've seen in a long time, and I'm glad I did. I'm glad I watched it."
23744,"Very dark, disturbing yet fascinating movie. Director John Schelsinger paints a very grimy portrait of NYC and its inhabitants. In that way it's dated--the city may have been this bad in 1969 but it's cleaned up"
23745,"One of the greatest movies ever made in America. It deserved every single award it won and it's place on the AFI Top 100 list (though it's shamefully too low on the IMDB Top 250 list, at only #18"
23746,"""Midnight Cowboy"" is one of the best films of that cyclonic decade. Deservedly, it won the best picture Oscar of 1969, and I would vote it as one of the best films of that cyclonic decade."
23747,A masterclass in acting/directing/ cinematography/ editing/ writing. brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
23748,"One of the strangest films I've ever seen, but I'm not sure I'd rate it high enough to give it a five star."
23749,"""Midnight Cowboy"" is one of the best films of the '70s...and it's not just because it was made in the '60s...it's because it was made in the '70s."
23750,"A dark story of dashed hopes, John Schlesinger creates haunting images of lost souls at the end of the 60s, and at the center, the prevailing friendship between two men as they struggle to make some sort of meaning to their lives"
23751,A great movie that won the Best Picture Oscar for Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight's performance. The editing is great and the music is great too.
23752,"""Midnight Cowboy"" is still a powerhouse showcase for two young actors just bursting into view at the time.<n>The film's cinematic influence can still be felt in the unspoken emotionalism found in Ang Lee's ""Brokeback Mountain"
23753,Fascinating downer about a would-be male hustler in New York City forced to live in a condemned building with a crippled con-man. Extremely bleak examination of modern-day moral and social decline.
23754,"Rural exodus is a socio-political issue of the 1960s. Thanks to this, Midnight Cowboy is a provocative view of a socio-political issue, the rural exodus."
23755,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
23756,"This is one hell of a great movie. This is one hell of a great movie. I saw it as a young naive punk when it was first released. Had me snifflin' like a baby as I left the theatre, trying not"
23757,Midnight Cowboy is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. I've seen it more times than I've seen it.
23758,One of Voight's best performances. He's one helluva stud..and he's gay..and he's gay..and he's gay..and he's gay.
23759,"One of the finest explorations of life, naivety and friendship ever released........."
23760,"A daring film for its time, and a foremost example of the kind of gritty landscape being explored in the more graphic films of the '60s. Symbolic of the ""end of innocence"" in American films."
23761,"Midnight Cowboy is not for everybody. It's raw, painful, and realistic but very entertaining. The lead actors Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman who would go on to become Oscar winning actors deliver amazing performances."
23762,"One of Dustin Hoffman's best performances in a long, long time........."
23763,"""Midnight Cowboy"" is one of the finest films ever made in America. No wonder it was a huge success when initially released. But be warned, its also one of the most heartbreaking films ever made."
23764,"An American In Paris is a showcase of Gene Kelly. Watch as Gene sings, acts and dances his way through Paris in any number of situations. One can imagine just what Kelly was made of as he made this film only a year before """

23766,"Oxford, Mississippi, at least. Okay, the Paris we get is Paris, Culver City apart from the Establishing library footage of the real McCoy but it IS Paris in spirit..."
23767,"A typical 50's movie musical by the Freed Unit at MGM and directed by Vincente Minelli with a lot of help from Gene Kelly. But, I think the rest of the cast needs some explanation."
23768,"An American in Paris is a wonderful musical about an American painter living in Paris for inspiration. He meets a rich woman who admires his paintings on the street and she believes she can get his work to be even more popular to the public,"
23769,"""An American in Paris"" is an integrated musical. The story is interspersed with show-stopping dance numbers choreographed by Gene Kelly and set to popular Gershwin tunes. Songs and music include ""I Got Rhythm,"" ""'S Wonderful,"" and """
23770,One of the better MGM musicals from the early '50's but it could have been done with a few less musical numbers...
23771,"Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron's ""An American in Paris"" dance sequence is the best in the film's entire run.<n>""An American in Paris"" is not the best all-around MGM musical, but there is certainly enough"
23772,A fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the movie a lot of charm
23773,An American in Paris is an all-encompassing form of visual entertainment today. But I think people sometimes forget that cinema is a certain DeMille picture that won the top award the following year.
23774,Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron are the living personification of several major painters in the ballet sequence at the end of An American In Paris. No wonder the sequence ended 'That's Entertainment' after all other MGM musical highlights had gone by!
23775,"A pretty good movie, but it's not a dynamite one. I can take or leave. Oscar Levant and Leslie Caron I can take or leave. All in all, a pretty good, but not dynamite movie."
23776,"Blood Castle is a very traditional Gothic Romance film. That's not to say that it's a bad film, but it's very slow."
23777,"What a brilliant film. Why wasn't it released to a wider audience? Had it not been made for TV, it could have got an Oscar nomination or 2."
23778,"The best movie about a serial killer I've ever seen. I can only recommend this to everybody who's interested in a well-made docu-drama, where the actors are still more important than the special effects."
23779,One of the best movies about serial killers I've ever seen. One of the best movies about serial killers that I've ever seen. One of the best movies about serial killers that I've ever seen.
23780,"An absolute must-see for anyone interested in criminology. Interpol relations and how the agencies work together are also great. I recommend it for anyone interested in Russian history, too."
23781,"The real villain is the stifling Soviet system, drowning in its own corrupted incompetence. The success of the story is precisely that: these were acts perpetrated by a person, a human like you or I. Where you and I choose to vent our"

23789,A superb and compelling drama about the hunt for the notorious Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. Magnificent performance from Stephen Rea as the forensic scientist put in charge of the investigation.
23790,Good example of a fast-paced Hollywood-style thriller that still gets across the basics of what happened. It is easy to follow and has just enough truth behind its version of events to make for compelling viewing.
23791,"Sutherland, Rea, DeMunn, and von Sydow are brilliant in their performances. Sutherland is particularly adept at this sort of role, where he must portray a character whose morality is, at first, uncertain to the audience."
23792,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time!"
23793,The most powerful film HBO has made to date. This film should have been released in theaters for the public to view on the big screen. It is available on video so make sure you look for it and check it...
23794,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it again and again. I've seen it again and again.
23795,Gerolmo's best film to date... and it's not just about the murder of a man. It's about the psychological characterization.

23797,Citizen X is one of the best movies about serial killers I have ever seen........

23800,"One of the best detective films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long, long time."
23801,"CitizenX is the developing world's answer to Silence of the Lambs. Where Silence' terrorized our peace of mind, Citizen' exhausts and saddens us instead."
23802,"A must-see for those who appreciate dry and dark humor and a look into the ""Regime"" community in Russia in the 80's and 90's."
23803,"A fascinating account of the hunt for the Soviet Union's first known serial killer. I had tuned in, just expecting a half-decent TV movie, but found myself drawn by the compelling way the story was told."
23804,"Excellent film. The whole picture was filmed in Budapest, so I feel proud. My little problem was that the trains in the film belonged to the Hungarian State Railways (MV)"
23805,One of the best detective stories I've seen in a long time..a must see for those who like a good detective story that will hold your interest..
23806,"One of the best movies I've seen. The film and its actors won several awards. It is gripping, fascinating, and it will absorb you completely."

23821,This film gives an insight into the trauma that a young mind can face when a family is split by divorce or other disaster. I would highly recommend this film especially to parents or individuals planning to have a family.
23822,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and it's just as good as the other ones I've seen, if not better."
23823,A very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between. I'm tired of the same old stuff in movies.
23824,"""Krisana"" succeeds as a character study with enough humor thrown in to keep it from being too self-serious. It could have easily fell into the trappings of a mystery story, but it avoids that and becomes an intelligent film about loneliness"
23825,A lovely tale of guilt-driven obsession. A lovely film noir with a lovely twist. A good Indie ending. A.S.A.M.
23826,One of the best films I've seen in a long time - and it's a black and white one too....
23827,"This movie is great. If you enjoy watching B-class movies, that is. This is a classic college 80's slasher movie, in which one song is played throughout the entire soundtrack."
23828,"one of the best movies i've seen in a long, long time........."

23835,"The best film I've seen in a long time, and I've seen it more than once........"
23836,"Visconti's ""Ossessione"" is one of the most influential films of the 20th century. It's not just about the movie, it's about the artist."
23837,"A haunting, powerful Italian adaptation of James M. Cain's novel The Postman Always Rings Twice directed by the great Luchino Visconti. What is so interesting about the film is that in every way it transcends it's source material"

23851,"Not the best version of Cain's story, but still a good film noir film. Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to great effect. Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors that keep the viewer interested."
23852,"Visconti's first film, a must-see for anyone who has ever seen a film by the great Italian director, a must-see for anyone who has ever seen a Visconti film."
23853,"Not as great as the 1946 American version but it's a great movie. Quite an impressive debut for Luchino Visconti, who continued to direct some more great and memorable Italian dramatic movies."

23856,"Not as good as the 1946 version of the same James M. Cain classic, but it's still a good Italian film, and a good one at that!"
23857,"Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice, but Ossessione is a better version of the classic noir story. It's a far greater study of the working class than crime."
23858,"Not as good as the American version, but not as bad as the Italian one either. But it's not as good as the American one either."
23859,"A bit disappointing, but still fun. I enjoyed the movie and have not seen it since. I learned later that this movie was underwritten by the government and Fox was paid on a cost plus basis, which maybe accounts for..."

23882,"Tarzan And His Mate is one of the best films in the series, and the second to star Weismuller as the jungle man of few words. It's damn sexy and there are some great action sequences!"
23883,"Tarzan and his Mate is the best in the Tarzan series, and Maureen O'Sullivan is the star of this movie. She's the most capable character in the entire cast. She's even got his own jungle scream now."
23884,Tarzan and his mate(1934) was the only Tarzan movie I didn't see when I was a kid. Now I have seen it. It's almost flawless. It's not harmonic and it's parts tend to live
23885,One of the best Tarzan movies ever made..and one of the best action movies ever made..and one of the best Jane O'Sullivans.
23886,One of the most entertaining examples of pre-code Hollywood out there. One of the most entertaining examples of pre-code Hollywood out there. One of the most entertaining examples of pre-code Hollywood out there.

23888,"Robert Wuhl is an excellent teacher of history and truth. He's a good actor and a good stand-up comedian, but he's an excellent teacher. I highly recommend that you watch an episode of this show."
23889,A must see for anyone who wants to learn about history and fiction in a fun and effective way. I would love to see this picked up as a series for HBO.
23890,Robert Wuhl is the funniest man I've seen in a long time. I've seen more of him on TV than I've seen in my life.
23891,This is a MUST see for anyone over the age of 16. this show had me and my 2 boys laughing out loud from the beginning. I don't know if everything on the show was true but the way it was presented left little
23892,"If you have ever had a dream to do something with your life, this film is for you. If you believe in yourself and your dream do not let anyone or anything stop you."
23893,You can do a lot with a little cash. Blair Witch proved that. It is no more than a sitcom in length and complexity. It manages to be hilarious even on a budget that couldn't afford a shoestring.

23897,"Not the most successful television project John Cleese ever did, ""Strange Case"" has the feel of a first draft that was rushed into production before any revisions could be made"
23898,One of my favorite shows back in the '70s. As I recall it went to air on Friday (or possibly Saturday)night on the Nine Network (?) here in Australia. Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland were great together.
23899,"One of the most exciting things I've seen in a long, long time. I wish I'd seen it in 1974 when I was 12 years old."
23900,"One of my all-time favorite sci-fi TV shows, and Darren McGavin's Kolchak was the perfect combination of comedy, drama, and sci-fi!"
23901,"The secret to Kolchak's success is in the title - ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"". Without Darren McGavin's lovable, bumbling Carl Kolchak to root for and to care for, then it just ain't"
23902,"The best of the ""Night Stalker"" spin-off TV series, but only lasted a single season and twenty episodes.<n>The best of the ""Night Strangler"" spin-off TV series, but only lasted a single season and"
23903,Kolchak should have been a hit. Darren McGavin begged to get out of his contract to end the show. Too bad the writing wasn't up to Richard Matheson's in the original TV movies.

23905,"""Kolchak"" was a TV series that really didn't fit into any category. Part horror, part comedy, some social awareness thrown in, and what we have is something that I think people weren't ready for."
23906,"KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER is a cult classic, but it's not quite as good as the TV series... but it's still fun!"

23918,"The Unborn is a pretty good low-budget horror movie exploiting the fears associated with pregnancy. It's very well acted by the always-good Brooke Adams and b-movie stalwart James Karen, although the supporting cast is pretty average for"
23919,The Unborn is a good horror/thriller that deserves to be more widely known & seen. It's got quite a clever story that works & plays on basic human fears.
23920,"The Unborn is a very, very different film. James Karen & Brooke Adams are in the film and they performed quite well. this film builds up solidly and it keeps you going. Though I think you must be a horror fan to watch"

23928,One of the scariest movies I've seen in a long time..........
23929,"A really good movie on a very tough topic, but I'm not sure if we needed the very last scene. Overall though a really good movie on a very tough topic."
23930,"This is a much better film than ""Elephant""<n>The characters are real human beings with logic and reasons behind their actions. It's not like they want to kill people for attention."
23931,One of the most intense films I've seen in a long time. The first movie in years that left me absolutely staggered. I could barely feel my way out of the theatre...
23932,"If you're a columbine fan, this movie is a must see. It's scary, it's scary, it's scary, it's scary, it's scary, it's scary."
23933,"""Zero Day"" is one of those movies that will mess with your head afterwards. The two main actors (Calvin Robertson and Andre Keuck) do such a good job that their characters seem like almost any disenfranchised teen walking the street."
23934,This is the best film adaptation of a school shooting of the few that have truly attempted it. I believe this is the best film adaptation of a school shooting of the few that have truly attempted it.
23935,zero day is one of the best films I have seen in a long time........
23936,What is really motivating these soon to be killers. It seems hard to really pinpoint. They certainly do not come across as cold blooded psychopaths yet they are planning an act of sheer brutality.
23937,"One of my all-time favorite movies. Why? Simple; Ben Coccio (writer, director)has put together a true piece of art. Where 99.9% of movies these days are purely entertainment, director Ben Coccio gives us"
23938,One of the best films I've seen in a long time. It's just too good not to get a perfect ten. It's too incredible not to be put into words.
23939,"An interesting approach to the phenomenon that is school shootings, but falls short of what it was intended to be. The film seems to want the audience to decide a lot, but also fails to provide the information for such an event."
23940,"Very interesting, but not as good as I thought it would be........."
23941,This movie made me feel bad. And that's why I can't go to sleep right now. There's still this little feeling in my stomach.

23951,A quiet study of Andy Goldsworthy's art and methods of making it. I think that a lot of the point of the movie is to show that Goldsworthy's art does not need any accompaniment in order for it to

23976,"You'll probably never see it, but the uncut version is about 50% better than the one you can buy. Put it another way: once you've seen it..."
23977,A lush fantasy world with quirky characters and annoying 80's music. This epitomizes the 80's desire to rewrite fairy tales and make fun of how they work. Personally I liked Greensleeves and the other harsher characters.
23978,"Bakshi's ""Lumage"" is about as far removed from the usual kiddie fare as anything made by Ralph Bakshi in his heyday. Brilliantly conceived characters such as the shape-shifting dog Ralph breathe life into a uniquely clever concept"

24034,Cillian Murphy and Brian Cox are the main reasons the film gets carried off........
24035,A thriller that actually is thrilling! Rachel McAdams dominates screen time in this nice little classic suspense thriller from famed horror film director Wes Craven. Craven even has a cameo as one of the passengers on the plane.

24060,"An excellent look into Hawaii's past and the people who lived there in that time. The time, money earned and the hours that these people had put into their lives to survive and live, takes a whole new meaning to blood, sweat"
24061,"For a mature man, to admit that he shed a tear over this film is a mature response, to a mature film. ""Life"" can never be the same, after viewing such advent for it has moved us to the next level."

24070,The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle is a wonderful movie about the love of a boy and the eagle he took care of. It touched me now as much as it did 40 years ago and now I own my own copy of it.

24102,"Lemmon and Matthau are the real stars of ""The Odd Couple"", and it's the best film of the 20th century. The best of all time."
24103,One of the greatest comic films of all times. Matthau and Lemmon are perfectly matched and mismatched. The script is so sharp that you need to staunch the bleeding.

24150,One of the better Looney Tunes cartoons from the early 1940's. It still remains as funny nearly 60+ years later. This animated short can be seen on Disc 1 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2.
24151,"""Haresleeveed"" is a fine example of how the Looney Tunes looked in the '40s before the Termite Terrace crowd polished them. But don't get me wrong, the cartoons were still really good after the refined forms arrived."
24152,One of the best action-adventure films I've seen in a long time! A must-see for every action-adventure fan! A must-see!
24153,"timothy dalton, jack nicholson, and a few other brits in this one.. a bit shocking, but overal it was a laugh."
24154,"A very good movie, in a very good way. James Belushi plays very well as Bill ""The Mouth"" Manuccie. But especially Timothy Dalton plays a very good roll as the Sheriff."
24155,Made men is well worth checking out. Louis Morneau isn't all that well known but he has done a perfectly OK job with this one and I never really grew impatient while watching the movie.
24156,What a good film! Made Men is a great action movie with lots of twists and turns. James Belushi is very good as an ex hood who has stolen 12 million from the boss who has to fend of the gangsters...

24159,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time..........
24160,It's not the best movie for either man. But Williams and Russell are actually a pretty good comedy team. And some of the names in this movie are likely to give you the giggles (to say the least)
24161,"""The Best of Times"" is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time......"
24162,Kurt Russell at his best as Reno Hightower. Robin Williams is his polar opposite in a rare low key performance as Jack Dundee. He dropped the Big Pass in more ways than one.
24163,"Why did this movie fail commercially? It's got a sharp script (by Ron Shelton) and great performances by Kurt Russell and, especially, Robin Williams, in a brilliant manic nerd turn that's different from any of his other work"
24164,One of the great sleepers of all time. Kurt Russell puts in one of his best performances. Robin Williams playing Jack Dundee is sure-footed as ever.
24165,"This movie is about such a concept. Williams will go to any low in order to replay the football game that haunts his life. Russel plays the ex jock who peaked in high school. Finally the under dog get its shot, and Williams can"
24166,"One of the best football films ever made. Kurt Russell is great as the legendary Remo Hightower. Robin Williams is ok, but Holly Palance does a nice turn as Williams' wife."
24167,"Not the best film ever put to screen, but enjoyable. Not the best film ever put to screen. Robin did well with his role. Cleaned up here as not to offend anyone."
24168,"I love this movie, but the music at all the alumni gatherings is just stupid. I found those dance scenes very jarring to my otherwise willing suspension of disbelief in the rest of the film."

24176,A fine effort for an Australian show. which is probably not surprising seeing as there seems to be somewhat of a resurgence in quality Aussie drama. abe forsythe may be the saving light (not that it needs saving) if this
24177,A simple and clear plot but it drew me in and kept me captivated all the way through. So many of the characters were so real. It moved me and made me think I would like to watch more like this.
24178,one of the best British films of the 60's.. a must see for anyone who's a fan of the BBC's drama series.
24179,"Timothy Spall shines in ""Mr. Harvey Lights a Candle""<n>""Good will towards men"" is the best evocation of ""good will towards men"" than I've seen in most holiday-themed TV movies"
24180,"A fitting one to be shown around Easter time. It reminded us of our spiritual selves and showed that behind our facades, we often hide our deepest sufferings and experiences."
24181,One of the most inspiring movies I've seen in a long time - and I'm not just saying that because I'm a fan of Timothy Spall!
24182,"Bittersweet, Bittersweet, Bittersweet, Bittersweet, Bittersweet, Bittersweet, Bittersweet, Bittersweet, Bittersweet, Bittersweet, Bittersweet, Bittersweet, Bittersweet, Bittersweet, Bittersweet, Bittersweet,"
24183,A great vehicle movie in the tradition of Abbot & Costello or more recently Don Knotts. It won't shake the world or change movies forever. When all is said & done that's the most important thing anyway.
24184,"""Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark"" is one of the best horror parodies ever made. It is full of cute, gross, bawdy, and clever humor carried through by the many sight gags, puns, props, songs"
24185,"ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK - A SCARY SCARY MOVIE RE-Spoofing It's Better Than The First One!"

24187,"""Elvira, Mistress of the Dark"" Deserves a peek (The film, not her boobs, of course). Deserves a peek (The film, not her boobs, of course)."
24188,One of the best movies ever made! I've seen it countless times and I never get tired of it! I've seen this movie countless times and I found myself captivated throughout the whole movie!

24191,"One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time, but it's not a comedy genius. I don't think I've seen one like this in a long time."
24192,"I love Elvira and I like this movie. It's very pity that second part had no success, because it very funny like a first part. I also regret that besides of this movie I have no seen Cassandra Peterson in other films"
24193,"Elvira, Elvira, Elvira, Elvira! Elvira, Elvira! Elvira, Elvira! Elvira! Elvira! Elvira! Elvira! Elvira! Elvira! Elvira! Elvira!"
24194,"elvira mistress of the dark is one of my fav movies, it has every thing you would want in a film, like great one liners, sexy star and a Outrageous story!"
24195,Elvira is bigger than she is and she keeps them covered up. A movie is the best thing to show off how funny she can be or how she commands attention.
24196,"Elvira is a good movie, if you like a good campy feature film every now and then. By no means is this movie fine cinema, but if you dont take things too seriously, and can laugh at yourself once in a while"
24197,"this movie is funny and it's not all that hard to laugh at.. but it's not all that easy.. no i'm totally ill give it a 9 hope you understand that you will laugh, you will scream"

24200,"""Elvira, Mistress of the Dark"", the first Elvira film from the 80's, finally comes to life. It's funny, it's funny, it's funny, it's funny."
24201,"This is a classic that reminds me of the good days of USA Up All Night.brbrI ended up having a great time with this cult classic about horror comedy, Halloween parties, sassy humor, and some sexy evil displayed"
24202,"Elvira has a primordial quality. With her lengthy, well-toned figure, large-bust, innocuously mischievous attitude and grab-bag lexicon of me-generation valley slang, the character of Elvira has a universal and timeless appeal."
24203,"It could have been better, but it's just a funny gag. brbr br br br br br br br br br "

24207,"ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK - Cassandra Peterson's best work to date........."
24208,Elvira is the queen of the one-liners. This film is very amusing. Elvira is the modern-day Chesty Morgan and the queen of the one-liners. This film was followed up a few years later by the abysmal
24209,"You must see this film, to understand the reality. Having read the book, Ms. Duke is now an advocate for those afflicted with bipolar disorder; formerly labeled manic-depression."
24210,"It took a lot of guts for her to come forward. But, in her case, what she did was remarkable. I have been in the mental health field for five years and I think it is great that mental illness is not a terrible"
24211,"This is such a great movie ""Call Me Anna"" because it shows how a person has suffered for so long without knowing what was wrong with her. For Patty Duke to come out in the publics eye and tell her story is an inspiration"
24212,Patty Duke's life and struggles with manic depression were just like my life struggles. I saw myself acting out just like her. I was so amazed at the similarities of our lives to include the sexual abuse that we both endured as children.
24213,"One of the best films I've ever seen, and one of the best movies I've ever seen. I've seen it three times."
24214,"This is a movie you shouldn't only see, but feel with your heart and soul. This is a movie you shouldn't only see, but feel with your heart and soul."
24215,One of the best thrillers I have seen in a long time..........
24216,"I remember seeing this movie a long time ago, back then even though it didn't have any special effects, the acting was really good. And it still has the same message for today"
24217,"The message that is sent in this film is very powerful. (for fear of spoiling it) So go out and see this film! If you don't like the message that it sends, then you have issues, that need some attention"
24218,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, if not for a lack of budget. I'd give it 5 stars if I could."
24219,An excellent fictional account of the weeks leading up to the RAPTURE and the weeks following that pivotal event.brbrI thoroughly enjoyed both the production values and the content values of this independent Christian movie.
24220,"This is a great movie. Some will disagree with me but, if you know anything about the bible you know it is. I think everyone should see it!!"
24221,A Thief In The Night is the best out of all the end times thrillers. Don't listen to the whiners. Don't listen to them.
24222,What a different world the America of 1972 was compared to our psychotic 21st Century. You can get a sense of what an 1972 America gone by was like by watching this movie.
24223,One of the best movies I've ever seen about the rapture and the end times. I've seen it many times with family members of all ages.
24224,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, but it's not going to be made into a remake. I think that it would be interesting to do a remake of it."
24225,"For it's time, this movie was awesome...and yes if you have no desire to become a Christian, then why bother watching it. I saw this movie after I had already been saved and found it to be very moving."
24226,"A Great Movie for Non-believers and Believers alike! This Film was really eye-opening. I have seen this film several times. First, when I was four and I actually remembered it and then when I was 12."
24227,"""A Thief in the Night"" is a gripping story that held the viewer and definitely made him or her review their relationship with Jesus Christ. This movie, and its sequel ""Distant Thunder"" are must see movies."
24228,This is such a great film! Never mind the low rating here. I really loved it and found it to be a little hidden treasure.. It's story was so original and charming.. I really can't think of anything
24229,"Rock's first lead role, but he's having a lot of fun in this one......"
24230,"This movie is a remake of two movies that were a lot better. The last one, Heaven Can Wait, was great, I suggest you see that one"
24231,"It's a good movie, but it's not what you'd expect from a Chris Rock movie. I'm not saying that just as a Chris Rock fan, I'm saying this as a person who had low expectations"
24232,One of my favorite movies of all time. I saw it like 8 times in the theater and got the DVD. As I got older and saw it again I realized that the movie is average.
24233,One of the funniest movies i've seen in a long time. I can't believe it's finally coming out on DVD. I can't wait to see it!
24234,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time! Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious! Hilarious!

24237,The best movie I've seen in a long time. I've seen it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over
24238,This movie is funny because it's about a young black comedian who dies and is sent back to earth in a mid-50's white mans body.
24239,"'The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine' is one of the more understated 'Twilight Zone' episodes, focusing on an aging movie star's inability to cope with the changing times and only introducing a supernatural element in the closing minutes."
24240,"The 16mm shrine is a great episode, but it's not as good as it's sometimes made out to be. I felt Lupino was unconvincing throughout, with only a few scenes that could count as memorable."
24241,"A bit too much to wrap your head around, but perhaps a bit of a comfort to those who wish they could go back to a simpler time and place"
24242,Clara Bow's best performance in a long time...even if it's not quite her best work...and it's not a great story-line!
24243,"OK Clara Bow silent film from 1927, it's a spin-off of Rain, with Bow playing the half-Hawaiian wild daughter of the local king who falls in love with the English engineer--Clive Brook."

24247,"If you loved Long Way Round you will enjoy this nearly as much. It is educational, funny, interesting and tense. Charley shares the screen with two interesting teammates, two tired mechanics, two excellent cameramen and too much Russ. Great stuff"
24248,Charlie's 'Race to Dakar' is a must-have for any motorbike fan! :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D
24249,"Not as good as the Long Way Round, but still fun to watch. The most realistic reality show I've ever seen, but not as good as the Long Way Round."
24250,"This is a great show, I love the pace and the music.. I cant believe he broke his collar bone. I really hope its not the end, I cant wait to see the next episode."

24254,"One of the best adventure movies I've seen in a long, long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long, long time!"
24255,"Not the finest pirate yarn ever brought to the screen but it's a solid example of this prolific genre all the same. Nowadays, the amorous persistence of the child-like Indian princess (Alice Kelley) towards her pirate captor Flynn"
24256,The Secret of Kells is a lovely little film. I've been waiting for years for it to come out. I'm here to tell you now it's been worth the wait.

24262,"The Secret of Kells is a fun little history lesson with a little adventure and silliness thrown in to keep people interested. But based on the 20 films submitted for Oscar consideration, I don't think it was worth being nominated over Mary and"
24263,The Secret of Kels is a beautiful piece of children's cinema buried in a world of archaic Celticism. The girl of the forest is a wonderful addition and in my opinion makes the picture what it is.
24264,"One of the oddest movies I've ever seen, but one of the best animated films I've seen in a long time...."
24265,One of the best animated films I've ever seen. Its a real warts and all story that is unlike any of the other Oscar nominees and any other film from this year or any other year.
24266,"One of the most beautiful and unique films in recent memory. The product is one of the most beautiful and unique films in recent memory. The story of the film isn't especially deep, but it's a pretty good fantasy tale."
24267,One of the best movies I've ever seen on eating disorders. I think it's better than the others I've seen on the subject.
24268,This is a very powerful film and is good support for anyone suffering from an eating disorder to give them the willpower to stop. This is what films should be about- they should be there to help people and not glamourise things that are wrong

24282,"A nice little horror flick that fans of indie films will really appreciate. It has good acting, lots of gore, and a decent plot. One will be reminded of movies like The Hills Have Eyes and Pumpkinhead."
24283,"Téa Leoni, Holland Taylor, and a lot of other funny people. I love this show. It's a great rerun, if you haven't seen it yet."

24289,Why women fall for the bad boy who will hurt when they have a ready caring boyfriend and good-hearted husband around....

24294,A character study on how this family deals with its subject. The film is a character study on how this family deals with its subject. Nowhere but in France could this story make it to the movies because of the subject matter.
24295,"A fascinating study of a family in crisis. When Leo, the oldest announces that he is HIV+ the reactions of the family alone and with each other was touching and yet strange."
24296,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it over and over again. I'm still thinking about it.

24298,"One of the best gangster films of the 80's, and still one of Pacino's best too......"
24299,One of the best gangster movies to ever come out of the 80s! Al Pacino is brilliant as Tony Montana and Michelle Pfeiffer is wonderful as Elvira!
24300,''Scarface'' comes at you like a raging bull. It doesn't so much engage the viewer as assault him. ''Scarface'' is voracious as a production as Tony Montana himself. Nothing is left to the viewer'

24303,"DePalma, Stone, and the gang present an ambitious, disturbing, and darn right good film. Tony Montana's rise to power drives the point disturbingly home."
24304,"An Oliver Stone-scripted remake of Hawks' classic, but a change in genre... But, as always, the focus is on decadence, lust and violencememorably a sickening chainsaw murder, rather than social reasons for the hood"
24305,One of Al Pacino's best roles in a long time.<n>One of Brian DePalma's Brightest points in his career.
24306,One of Pacino's Best Performances in a Long Time..........
24307,One of the most influential movies in the past 25 years but it seems to be for the wrong reasons. This has probably been one of the most influential movies in the past 25 years but as mentioned before it is for the wrong reasons.
24308,Scarface is one of the greatest gangster movies of all time. Al Pacino is the star.......
24309,This is one of my favorite films of all time. Al Pacino acting is at its best and the story is excellent. Too bad it didn't do to well in the 80's when it was first released...

24315,"One of the most definitive gangster films of the 80's, Scarface is very much a film of its time. The costumes, the music score and soundtrack, make no mistake about it this is a film all about crime in the 80's"
24316,"One of the best gangster movies of all time, one of Brian De Palma's best films, one of the best gangster movies of all time, one of the best gangster movies ever made!"

24318,"This movie is very entertaining and is never ever boring even running at nearly 3 hours. Al Pacino, Michelle Phieffer and the rest of the cast are great in the film and are very believable."
24319,"One of the greatest crime movies of all time, and one of the best of all time. Brian DePalma is one of the greatest directors of all time."
24320,"""Say hello to my little friend!"" is in Scarface. The classic phrase is what always comes to mind when I think about Brian DePalmas movie, Scarface. This falls under my top 10 favorite movies."
24321,"one of the best 80's movies ever made, if you have a chance to see it, you should see it. ""So say good night to the BAD guy"""
24322,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it many times and I've watched it over and over again.
24323,This is the best movie ever made. I just cant see why this movie isnt in the top 250. I also can't see why anybody would not love Scarface.
24324,"One of the better space films I've seen in a long time. It's better than I expected, but not as good as I expected."
24325,"I agree with ""Jerry."" It's a very underrated space movie (of course, how many good low-budget ones AREN'T underrated?)"
24326,"One of those movies that you just watch and try not to analyze too hard. The acting is rather amateurish, at best. The story line is rather stock, but with an interesting twist. Still the movie has its moments and is quite"
24327,"A unique look at western life from the point of view of a wild horse, and native Americans. Not one to be missed. (10/10) An excellent film which I enjoyed immensely, and that is suitable for all the family."
24328,"If you are feeling beaten down, this movie will free your mind and set you soaring. We all know how tough life can be, sometime we need to be reminded that persistence and courage will get us through."
24329,This is the best movie I have seen in a long time. I have seen it over fifty times by now because of the kids who just cant get enough of Spirit.
24330,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and I've seen it more than once. I've seen it more than once."
24331,"Well, what can I say, this movie really got to me, it's not so bad, as many say, I really loved it, although the idea seems so simple, and..."
24332,The horse is indeed a fine animal. Picturesque depictions of wild horses and their grace could never have been more majestic in an animation flick. The animation forms the backbone of the beauty that the horses embolden across the flick.
24333,I liked this movie a lot. The animation was well done and the romance was cute. I liked most of Bryan Adams' songs and the Hans Zimmer score was excellent.
24334,"""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"" is one of the best animated films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've ever seen"
24335,"An amazing movie, filled with beautiful scenery, animation, and an amazing storyline that has the great potential to warm one's heart. This was a really nice vacation from the Lady And The Tramp animated movies that everyone today is used to."

24343,Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is the best animated movie I've seen in a long time! I've seen it 3 times and loved it!

24345,"Not a great film, but good entertainment for small children. Not bad, but could have been much better. Not bad, but could have been much better."

24350,One of the best films I've seen in a long time - and it's not just for Pacino fans. It's for the whole family.
24351,"One of our family's favorites -- the art direction is exceptional -- the music is magic. It's not supposed to be ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" -- it's a fun experience"
24352,"One of the few movies which succeeded in doing so, thanks to a serious script, good direction, great performances and a powerful mix of cinematography, art direction and costume design"
24353,"One of the best films I've seen in a long, long time........."
24354,Don't look for an overdeveloped plotline here....just sit back with some popcorn and enjoy this one. A gallery of stars pop up as the classic cartoon character's villains in this live action comedy
24355,"The best comic book based movie made to date. The movie has the same feel as the comic book, staying true to the color scheme. The Batman series has climbed, fallen, climbed and fallen again. Dick Tracy has true staying power as"
24356,"A true to form take on the ""Dick Tracy"" persona and Madonna's musical element to this film is just so well done and performed musically and tuned to that era. In my mind Madonna's finest moment both on-screen but"
24357,One of my all time favorite films. You will either really love it or really hate it. It came out a year after the success of Batman. So everyone's expectations were so high that many were let down simply because the plot is

24364,This movie won more than it's share of awards. Won 3 Oscars. Another 5 wins & 26 nominations.... right there tells me it's better than a 5.8.
24365,"""Escapist"" can be good, and ""Dick Tracy"" can be good. This is truly one entertaining movie. As the eponymous, yellow-clad, fearless title character, Beatty creates a detective to whom we can all relate"

24367,"The best movie to watch for comic book feel. The sets, costumes and the color are just so vivid it is just like stepping into a comic book."
24368,"One of the best films I've ever seen, and it's not just because it's based on a comic book. It's based on a real person."

24371,"Warren Beatty at his best with a cast that includes Madonna, Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Sorvino, William Forsythe, R.G. Armstrong"
24372,"A fun, smart, entertaining movie with solid acting and a solid script. I don't think you will be disappointed. And Watch for the cameos from Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Kathy Bates and Dustin Hoffman among others."
24373,One of the best children's shows I have ever seen..........
24374,"Fragglerock is excellent in the way that Schindler's List was excellent. A Great watch for children and adults of all genders. Big noses can be seen as hinting towards phallic symbols, in the same way that H.R"
24375,A great movie if you are looking for something to laugh at. If you want a good movie maybe look for something else but if you don't mind a laugh at the expense of a man in a monkey suit grab yourself a copy.
24376,"Not as bad as I thought it would be, but it's still not the best Sasquatch movie ever. It's not supposed to be taken seriously, and if viewed that way, it's quoit enjoyable."
24377,"Not as good as Sasquatch, but it's still worth a watch......."
24378,"Powers Boothe's mesmerizing performance makes it all come true. Worth watching, if only to keep in mind one of the truly horrific events of the 20th century."
24379,Powers Boothe steals the show as the cult figure Jim Jones of the Peoples Temple..... The movie keeps you riveted and is a must see for anyone.
24380,"A good summary of a real event! But, actually, did that last scene on the air station really take place? But, actually, did that last scene on the air station really take place?"
24381,"I've seen this film literally over 100 times...it's absolutely jam-packed with entertainment!!! Powers Boothe gives a stellar performance. As far as I'm concerned, Powers Boothe IS Jim Jones...this film captures his"
24382,Powers Booth is hypnotic as cult leader jim jones who led his Peoples Temple followers from 1953 until 1978 where over 900 died. A very well done movie which may seem a little dated due to the 70s time period but well worth the
24383,"A superb recreation of the life of the Rev. Jim Jones, who built a church into a virtual empire, and then encouraged it to disintegrate into a sleazy cult in which 917 cult followers committed suicide by drinking Kool-Aid doused with"
24384,I will never forget this film or the events that lead up to Jonestown in Guyana. It just seems so tragic but needs to be told. Powers Boothe give a commanding performance as the leader Rev. Jim Jones from obscurity until total madness
24385,"This is not a documentary, but a TV movie. Quite good, and for the most part pretty accurate, considering it IS a TV movie rather than a documentary. They did create some fictional characters, and combine several actual people into one character"
24386,"""Shades of Grey"" is the first recap episode in the TNG series. This entire episode is a heck of a reminder that a LOT of crazy, great things have happened already in a mere 2 seasons with 5 more to go and"

24388,"A very intriguing short movie by David Lynch, and saying the name David Lynch is probably enough for a lot of people. It is probably especially for Lynch fans but there is a chance you like this."
24389,"David Lynch's new short is a very ""Lynchian"" piece, full of darkness, tension, silences, discreet but very textured background music, and features again two beautiful actresses, a blonde and a brunette"
24390,"An artist's sketch of a sort, as with any true artist. This is an artist's touch/feel to it, as with any true artist."
24391,"lynchianism at its best. And in good right. I will agree with anyone that people that start viewing this with the desire to be entertained without any really imaginative work from the viewer's side, will find themselves disappointed."
24392,"It's a short movie from David Lynch with just 8 minutes, but it got all the ""Lynchian ingredients""! It's mysterious, dark, inconclusive, eerie, and strange; and before the blond girl starts to talk it"
24393,"This is almost typical Lynch. However, What makes this film slightly unusual for Lynch is the fact that it looks very raw, almost amateurish. But i believe Lynch does this on purpose to give a greater sense of realism, which serves to"
24394,"""Darkend Room"" is a Lynchian short film with two beautiful girls in a strange, mysterious situation. I would say this short is definitely more on the ""Mulholland Drive"" end of the Lynchian spectrum"

24397,"Not Politically Correct or Neo-Marxist, but a good film about the history of European colonisation in the Americas and southern Africa with no particular inaccuracies."
24398,"The original theory of ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" is presented in this series. The series graphically portray several episodes strongly supporting the theory, and defend the theory against common criticism."
24399,A fascinating and thought provoking documentary on the evolution of society and the nature of the right crops and animals to live on.....
24400,A good look at the 'culture warriors' of the West..........
24401,"This series adds new information and background to the book and includes personal appearances by the author and by archaeologists and other anthropologists. It brings the book to life and makes even more sense of the author's subsequent opus, *Collapse*"
24402,Please don't ruin this great piece by your simple mindedness. The reasons are far more complex than the single thing you mentioned. Please read the book as is it a great source of information. I enjoyed it a lot
24403,"One of the best chase films of the late 60's, if not the early 70's......"
24404,"Good, but not as good as I thought it would be. I'd give it 7/10, but I'd give it more if I could."

24410,"Seduction is a low budget, non-hardcore erotic film company that has a cult following for its work. This one is a fun, fast paced film."
24411,Not as good as the original but it's a good attempt at a sequel........
24412,"British films can lord it over their U.S. competitors. A shift in outlook is neccesary to enjoy modern British films, one that somehow allows them to be seen in their own right and for their own qualities."

24414,"Heston, Coburn, Parks, Mitchum, &amp; Hershey make this a must-see for western fans.<n>The Last Hard Men needs to be released on DVD or VHS soon."
24415,One of the best westerns I've seen in a long time. brbr James Coburn is the star. brbr. br. br. br. br
24416,Charlton Heston and James Coburn in a really good Western.. Very good film.. Very good to watch.. Very good score from the late Jerry Goldsmith..
24417,One of the best westerns I've seen in a long time! Charlton Heston and Charles Coburn are at their very best in this one!
24418,"Not a great movie but above the average because of a great Coburn, a very good beginning and some gory and violent scenes. What I miss is the typical western action in the middle of the movie."
24419,"Good, but not as good as it could have been. Heston and Cobern are good, but not as good as they could have been.."
24420,"A very interesting film. Charlton Heston,(Sam Burgade),""Midway"",'76, had past experiences with James Coburn,(Zach Provo),""Deadfall"",'93, and Zach never forgave Sam and"

24422,A must see for anyone who believes in God's message of love and forgiveness as the Savior taught us to do in Jesus's name. A must see for anyone who believes in God's message of love and forgiveness as the Savior
24423,"Very well made, well acted, and had a nice score. If you get to Salt Lake City, it is a must to see it in the Legacy Theater."
24424,I am stunned at the negative comments that I have read and can only assume that the people making such comments were less than honest. This is the most moving and real portrayal of Joseph Smith that I have ever seen.
24425,"The story of Joseph Smith stands out as an amazing - even moving - episode in American history and World Religious history. This movie portrays events in the life of Joseph Smith, whom Mormons revere as the prophet of the restoration of the true Church"
24426,"It made me want to be a better person, it made me want to strive to be a better person, they went through so much and we kind of take that for granted, I guess. Compared to that, I feel like our own"
24427,This is a great movie about Joseph Smith and what he stood for and what the LDS church believes. If you don't know much about Joseph Smith and what the LDS church believes then this is the movie to see.
24428,This is one of the most spiritual movies I have ever seen. I headed up with about 150 people to St. George and we saw this movie in the visiting center of the St. George temple.. Not one person had dry eyes in
24429,"The most amazing movie about the restoration of the gospel. Far better than any other film, or movie made about the restoration thus far. You won't regret it!"
24430,The best movie I have ever seen. Everyone was touched by what they saw and I have not been the same since I have seen it. I highly recommend this movie for everyone.
24431,"The Restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is a true and historical film. It is very useful to those researching the LDS church, because it is 100% true."

24487,One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.........
24488,Woody Allen's best since the 80's!! Hugh Jackman was the perfect pick for his roll. Scarlett Johansson's banter with Woody proves how well rounded an actress she has become.
24489,"Scarlett Johansson, Woody Allen, Hugh Jackman, Ian McShane, Romola Garia, Sondra and Sid in a Corky, zany, fun comic ride"
24490,"if you love woody allen, you'll love this movie. it's funny, it's romantic, and it's a murder mystery."

24595,"One of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time. Very well done. Barbara Steele does a good job as the female lead. George Riviere, the male lead, does a good job with his role."
24596,Babs Steele and Klaus Kinski at their best in this classic horror film. A must-see for any fan of the macabre..! A must-have for anyone who has ever seen a Babs Steele/Klaus Kinski
24597,A good example of the quality work in the horror genre being turned out in Italy in the 60s. Castle of Blood is a good example of the quality work in the horror genre being turned out in Italy in the 60s.
24598,One of the best Italian horror films of the 60's - and one of Antonio Margheriti's best too!

24605,Wonderful family drama/comedy starring MacClaine and Garr that entertains and warms the heart every time I see it. Strongly recommended for all ages from 9 year olds to grannies
24606,Shirley MacLaine in another tailor-made role. As the aunt to a single mom in a 1962 working-class Chicago neighborhood. The veteran character actress gets another work-out as a gutsy woman who won't let any set-
24607,One of the earliest (and very few) British films noirs. I think it's closer to the Gothic old-dark-house tradition than the American one of wet cobblestones and urban corruption.
24608,"""Julia Ross"" is a little too short, but it stays the course nicely until a too-rushed climax, which feels a little sloppy. *** from ****"
24609,"One of the best thrillers I've seen in a long, long time........"
24610,Nina Foch delivers a surprisingly strong performance as the title character in this fun little Gothic nail-biter. I was surprised by how well it held together despite its shoe-string budget and B-movie pedigree.
24611,"One of the best B pictures ever made. (B pictures were low budget pictures made quickly with low budgets and no major stars.) It's just as long as it needs to be (only 65 minutes, is well-directed,"
24612,One of Witty's best roles in a long time..........
24613,Joseph H. Lewis's first film as a director is a haunting Gothic oddity........
24614,"Greatly enjoyed this 1945 mystery thriller film about a young woman, Nina Foch,(Julia Ross) who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work."
24615,Why don't people believe her? Why don't people believe her? Why don't people believe her? Why don't people believe her? Why don't people believe her? Why don't people believe her?
24616,"Nina Foch's ""My Name is Julia Ross"" in this 1945 film noir. It's short, and because it is. It could have been a good fifteen minutes to a half hour longer."
24617,"One of the best film noirs of all time, and it was made on a low budget. That is the charm of film noir, the real film noir: It is small, convincingly lowlife, and, in this case, unforgettable"
24618,"A lovely little B picture with all the usual Joe Lewis touches.... people ripping up pillows and auras of lurking fear. Also, an ending that comes out of nowhere, because, apparently, the auteur has lost interest in the movie"
24619,"What if Einstein, Monroe, Dimaggio and McCarthy were to come together in a mind-bending evening of relativity?brbrThis delightful roman  never uses the actual names of the characters it so thinly veils and scathingly"
24620,"One of Nicolas Roeg's most interesting projects... but it takes a while to adjust to the role-reversals of the four protagonists: Einstein, McCarthy, Munroe, and DiMaggio"
24621,One of Nicolas Roeg's best films and one of Theresa Russell's best as well. One of my favorite films of all time and one of Russell's best.
24622,"It's flawed, but I think it's excellent. So don't expect to come away feeling all happy-happy, because it's likely you'll be disappointed."
24623,"This is the best film I've seen in a long, long time, and it's not just because it's dialogue heavy. It's character-driven."
24624,"One-of-a-kind, one-of-a-kind, one-of-a-kind, one-of-a-kind"
24625,"Insignificance is both apposite and deeply ironic. Here, DiMaggio's net worth has been reduced to little more than a picture on a denture card."
24626,"Theresa Russell as Marilyn Monroe, Michael Emil as Einstein, and a pretty good script by Nic Roeg, but a bit too long for its own good."

24681,One of the best films I have seen in a long time - and I'll read my Tintin albums with a different eye after having seen this one!
24682,"""Tintin and I"" first of all struck me as a masterpiece documentary. The photography and the editing are truly breath-taking (almost anti-Dogma)"
24683,A must see for anyone who loves the world of Tintin..<n>A must see for anyone who has a close relationship with the world of Tintin..
24684,"A brilliant documentary that follows the life of Herge and his creating TinTin. Its based around a series of interviews conducted in 1971, and covers every thing from his early life and ""Nazi collaboration"" to the final moments of his life."
24685,"A good look at Herge's life, but not as good as some of his other books. The movie does not address the shift in the Tintin books from early rightist and imperialist books to fairly anti-imperialist books"
24686,"A great look at Herge's life and Tintin's early years. I've read Breaking Free, but haven't seen it yet."

24689,Jane Austen's Emma is an extremely enjoyable story at the worst of times and this production of the story is the best I have ever seen. Kake Beckinsale's Emma is irreproachable.
24690,"A better adaptation than the one with Paltrow (although I liked that one, too), but the screenplay is better. Davies is a master at adapting Austen for filming, and the production values here are very good."
24691,"Kate Beckinsale is excellent as the manipulative and yet irresistibly charming Emma in this TV-adaptation of Jane Austen s novel.<n>Raymond Coulthard is perfect as Mr. Frank Churchill, expressing this character s personal"
24692,"One of the sweetest, merriest things I have ever seen, rather in the nature of a Christmas treat. For me this production was and remains a delight."
24693,"Not as good as Paltrow's, but better than Strong's version of Austen's Knightley, but it's still a good movie!"
24694,"One of my favourite adaptations of an Austen novel. Although it is definitely not in the same category as the spectacular ""Pride and Prejudice,"" ""Emma"" is a lush and relatively faithful TV version of Austen's novel -- especially considering its short"

24696,"Not as good as the movie, but better than the Paltrow version........."
24697,Kate Beckinsale steals the show! Too bad Knightly ins as good looking as Jeremy Northam. Bernard Hepton was perfect as Emmas father.
24698,"Jane's ""ruts"" are our ""ruts"" even at this late date. This TV mini-series gives it a mannered telling suitable to the novel."
24699,"Jane Austen's ""Emma"" finally made into a film in 1996- and it's better than the TV version, but it's not as good as the movie"

24701,An excellent production that I am very happy to own on DVD!!! So once again thank you BBC for another quality piece of television. I liked it so much that I watched it twice in two days!!
24702,"This is the best Emma in existence in my opinion. Having seen the other version (1996) which is also good, I think I can safely say with confidence that this is the true interpretation and is the most faithful to Jane Austen's masterpiece."
24703,"Not as good as the Paltrow version, but still a nice example of a ""film"" version of a classic novel...."
24704,"Kate Beckinsale is as good as Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma in this movie, although I really liked Gwyneth Paltrow in the other Emma version. They're both good in different ways."
24705,"A masterpiece, but it took me at least 4 o 5 times to see it, so as to realize what a great movie it was. First, it describes a face of WW2 that we don't usually see in Hollywood movies."
24706,"""Lili Marleen"" belongs to Fassbinder's ""women movies"" like ""The Marriage of Maria Braun"" (1979) and ""Lola"" (1981)"
24707,"Good for those who like sweet, slightly screwball comedies, but not so good for those looking for a realistic plot or a believable plot. A really nice little curio from the late 1950s."
24708,"Excellent farce! Which, of course, is all it is intended to be. Could the plot actually take, or have taken place in any particular time or location?"
24709,One of the few seriously trying to deal with the U.S. Government's yearly demand for taxes. I have always liked this comedy as one of the few ever seriously trying to deal with the U.S. Government's yearly
24710,A charming movie from an era gone by. Hollywood needs to consider a charming remake of this movie. My wife and I would go see it.brbrIt is an excellent romantic comedy that my wife and I watched on AMC.

24712,"""The Incredible Melting Man"" is a gross, trashy and energetic Z-grade production that every self-respecting camp-horror freak simply has to see for him/herself!"
24713,"Don't let the door hit you on the way out either. Hilarious, disgusting fun best enjoyed with a crowd of friends and plenty of beer. Why can't people have made more movies like these?"
24714,One of the best low-budget sci-fi/horror movies I've seen in a long time.....
24715,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I've never seen one that was so bad......

24721,This is the best made-for-TV movie of all-time! Am I saying this because I'm a huge Silverstone fan? I'd still see it.
24722,Alicia Silverstone and Kevin Dillon did a great job. It's a good movie for people who know who the killer was from the beginning. I would recommend it to other people. It comes on Lifetime movie network quite a lot.
24723,not like the teen-slasher movies that pop out every now and then.the search for the killer and the 'partner' relationship between the hero and the so-called bad guy was parts i liked about the movie.
24724,True Crime is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time........
24725,it's called back-up.sometimes these movies make me mad when people act stupid and do stupid things.but that's what i think about the movie.
24726,This is a nice piece of work. Very sexy and engaging enough plot to keep my interest throughout. Its main disadvantage is that it seems like it was made-for-TV: Full screen
24727,"Very good drama about a young girl who attempts to unravel a series of horrible crimes. She enlists the aid of a police cadet, and they begin running down a series of clues which lead to a traveling carny worker with a long police"

24740,One of the classic scenes of the post-war cinema brbr Welles did not miss a chance throughout the whole film to counterpoint the words and actions with visual detail which enriched the texture and heightened atmosphere brbr
24741,"One of the strangest, and most fun to watch. I say that because of the four main actors: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders."
24742,"One of the most misunderstood films of the 1940's, but it's worth a look......."
24743,"One of the greatest film directors of all time, but a flawed Welles, but worth every minute of it because one can see the greatness of perhaps America's best motion picture director of all times!"
24744,"""The Lady From Shanghai"" is one of the best films of the 20th century--and it's not just because it's a ""Citizen Kane"""
24745,"One of the best film-noir movies I've seen in a long time, but it's not quite as good as it could have been"
24746,"One of the big films made by Welles after returning from relative exile for making Citizen Kane. Dark, brooding and expressing some early Cold War paranoia, this film stands tall as a Film-Noir crime film."
24747,"The Lady from Shanghai is a good noir thriller, but if you're on drugs, don't watch it......"
24748,"The first real noir, but even darker. It's not an obviously twisted world, unless you think about the camera. What we can see firsthand is someone creating a vocabulary that would later become common."

24754,"What can I say, it's a damn good movie. See it if you still haven't. Great camera works and lighting techniques. Awesome, just awesome."
24755,Rita Hayworth and Orson Welles at their best in a fun murder mystery.........
24756,"The Lady From Shanghai is weird even by the standards of its eminent director, Orson Welles. It's a kind of post-modern film noir made during the period when more conventional films of this type were quite popular."
24757,"What was going on with ""The Lady from Shanghai"" and what the film could have been without studio interference?<n>""The Lady from Shanghai"" moves at a snail's pace, though I agree with one of the posters that films today"
24758,"I'm not a big fan of Orson Welles, but The Lady from Shanghai didn't quite work for me. I had a problem with most of the performances, the script and the overall structure."
24759,"Pure Orson Welles genius makes this one of the greatest of movies. Welles is drawn into a murder conspiracy only to be set up as the fall guy, which is what he refers to with the sarcastic comment ""big dummy that I am."""
24760,THE LADY FROM SHANGAI IS STILL ONE OF THE BEST FILM NOIR PICTURES IN THE WORLD...60 YEARS later and one hour of footage less
24761,"THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI IS NOT THE GREATEST, BUT IT'S A GREAT FILM NOVEL AND A KEY TO WELLES' HISTORY."
24762,"THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is proof that the great genius Orson Welles could direct a ""mainstream"" movie if he wanted to. The sweet surprise was the superb acting by the beautiful Rita Hayworth."
24763,One of the best films I've seen in a long time.........
24764,"One of the greatest actors of all time, a genius in his own right, a genius in his own time, a genius in his own time, a genius in his own time, a genius in his own time, a genius in his"
24765,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, but it's an odd viewing experience.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."
24766,One of the best films of the 1950's. Welles at his best. (8/10)... but it's a troubled production. (8/10)...
24767,"A GUY THING is a hilarious, witty, sexy, romantic, and totally beautiful chick flick that guys will also enjoy. I thought that Jason Lee and Julia Stiles dazzled as a bewildered groom-to-be and his soon-to"
24768,"Jason Lee and Selma Blair are great together in 'A Guy Thing', a comedy-drama about a man's misadventures on the eve of his wedding."
24769,Not as bad as I thought it would be...but not as bad as I thought it would be...and it's not the worst movie I've ever seen.
24770,"Not the sweet romantic comedy I expected, but something with a little edge. This movie wasn't afraid to take the jokes a little further. And Jason Lee does now how to deliver comedy, especially when his character is half-panicked"
24771,"If you want to tickle the proverbial funnybones, get this movie tonight. It may not be Academy Award material but it is absolutely guaranteed to turn a bad day into a darn good one."
24772,What would you say about a man who was about to get married and was having his bachelor party with some of his closest friends at a Hawaiian guy bar?
24773,"Not as funny as i expected, but still a good movie.........."
24774,"Jason Lee is good in everything he does. The only flaw in this movie is, I don't think there was enough chemestry between Lee and Julia Stiles."
24775,"Not a great movie, but not bad at all...if you want to laugh a few times...leave during the church scene, or you will be disappointed."
24776,Don't be put off by the horrible trailers and even more horrible box office records. Romantic comedies are getting so predictable nowadays that it feels like the genre itself is ready to be flushed down the toilet.
24777,One of the best romantic comedies I've seen in a long time.........
24778,"One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time, but it's not for the whole family. I could number many other scenes, but better off the reader rent buy this movie and have lots of fun."
24779,"""A Guy Thing"" may not be a classic, but it sure is a good, funny comedy. The plot focuses on Paul (Jason Lee), who wakes up the morning after his bachelor party with no memory and Becky (Julia Stiles)"
24780,One of the most interesting films I've seen in a long time.........
24781,One of the more memorable films I've seen in a long while. Hasn't left my mind and I look forward to future efforts by Bronstein
24782,One of the best films I've seen in a long time--and I've seen it more than once--but it's not for everyone.
24783,"""Frownland"" is a film that grows on you the longer you think about it. It is a film that is not for everyone, but one that challenges you to watch and grows on you the longer you think about it."
24784,"I found the film quite expressive, the way the main character was lost but at the same much more clear about certain things in life than people who mocked him..."
24785,"""What's the matter with Helen"" is the last drop of ""The Great Ladies of the Grand Guignol"" camp horror sub-genre."
24786,"Campy fun, but too often too close to a bad musical........."
24787,The best in a series of grand guignol movies to follow 'Baby Jane'. Reynolds and Winters are mothers of young convicted murderers (a nod to 'Compulsion') who run away to hide in Hollywood.
24788,"I was just starting to like the poms. ""I was just starting to like the poms."" ""I was just starting to like the poms."""
24789,"Renny Harlin's first American film was one of the best of a slew of prison-set horror films.Twenty years before,guard Lane Smith had wrongfully executed a condemned man.Now,he is the warden of the newly re"
24790,"One of the best horror films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long time."
24791,"One of the best 80's horror films of the 80's, but why is it so underrated?              "
24792,One of the best horror films I've seen in a long time - and it's not just because it's based on the box art.
24793,An excellent example of what can be done on a small budget movie. The acting is excellent considering the script & the whole atmosphere of the film is very foreboding.
24794,Prison is one of the best of the eighties horror films...but it's not one of the best of the decade...but it's one of the best of the lesser known/smaller films
24795,Prison is one of the best movies of Renny Harlin's career. The movie is creepy and has some good acting from a cast of (at the time) unknowns. Lane Smith comes off the best because his warden isn'
24796,One of the best slasher films of the 1980's                   
24797,One of the best horror films I've seen in a long time.........
24798,"One of the best horror films i've seen in a long time. brbrAn absolute diamond, a film i still have on video to this day. Check it out."
24799,"I was lucky enough to work on this movie. Both as an extra and with Eddie Surkin on special effects. It was fun to see all the behind the scene workings, from the Barbedwire coming alive to the Electric chair up"
24800,"One of the best horror movies made in the 80's - even if it's not the best of the 80's! I'm not saying it's the best of the 80's, but it's definitely worth it"
24801,"Better than average, but still a solid 7 of 10. Could have been told a little better, but still a solid 7 of 10. The Animatrix concept is brilliant, and despite a few issues, this short still fulfills its purpose."
24802,"The Second Renaissance is a good prequel to the first Matrix film, but it's not the best of the 9 short animes on the DVD, but it's a good watch."
24803,"It's not anti-human, it's not anti-machine, it's not anti-human, it's not anti-human"
24804,the first of a two part back-story to the conflict between the machines and mankind in the Matrix world. it delivers spectacularly by combining observations on man's fear of the unknown and of being usurped with politics.
24805,"What was missing was how things came to be in the real world. Say no more, because this part of the story covered most of the bases. Well represented and put together, this a true testament to how illogical humans can be."
24806,The Second Renaissance : The Second Renaissance : The Second Renaissance : The Second Renaissance : The Second Renaissance : The Second Renaissance : The Second Renaissance : The Second Renaissance : The Second Renaissance : The Second Renaissance
24807,"This is the second part of 'The Animatrix', a collection of animated short movies that tell us a little more about the world of 'The Matrix'"
24808,"The Matrix, the war between man and machine, the creation of the Matrix, the war between man and machine, the creation of the Matrix, the war between man and machine, the war between man and machine, the creation of the Matrix"
24809,"this is the greatest piece of animation ever created. the images and styles are amazing, and match perfectly with the story which is a brilliantly realistic reinterpretation of our own..."
24810,"""The Second Renaissance: Part I"" is by far the most effective in bringing out emotion. It's a sorrowful and disturbing view of the potential of humanity to become ""the architect of its own destruction."""
24811,"'The second beginning' shows us the beginning of the end for the human race. Set long before the matrix existed, this short anime shows us the world that could lay infront of us in the not to distant future."
24812,"'The Sentinel' is one of the best horror movies ever. Even after so many years, this film is still terrific. The cast is a constellation of stars and starlets. You can see many actors and actresses, who became famous,"
24813,Bizarre horror movie filled with famous faces but stolen by Cristina Raines as a pretty but somewhat unstable model with a gummy smile who is slated to pay for her attempted suicides by guarding the Gateway to Hell!
24814,One of the best horror films I've seen in a long time - and it's not just because I'm a fan of Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum!
24815,"The Sentinel is the beginning of the psychological thrillers in the same genre of Psycho. Cristina Raines gives an excellent performance as the lead, and Burgess Meredith gives an excellent supporting actor as the next-door neighbor."
24816,"One of the best movies of the 70's, and one of the best books of the 70's, and one of the best movies of all time."
24817,"''The Sentinel'' is one of the best horror movies already made in the movie's Industry! I personally find ''The Sentinel'' a very creepy movie, and along with ''The Exorcist'' they are two of the scariest"
24818,"An excellent, creepy 70s classic from director Michael Winner. I also recommended it for those who want something a little more imaginative beyond the usual stupid teenager slashers and horror comedy."
24819,"Michael Winner's ""The Sentinel"" is one of the best horror movies of the 70's. It's still one of the best movies of all time."
24820,The Sentinel is a fine horror film with plenty of psychological elements and some truly terrifying scenes. The end scene is repulsive and yet chilling. I do find fault with some of the gratuitous sex and violence in the film.
24821,"Not a bad little horror flick, maybe a good companion piece to ""Burnt Offerings"". 8 out of 10. Not a bad little horror flick, maybe a good companion piece to ""Burnt Offerings""."
24822,"One of the most bizarre horror movies I've seen in a long time, but it's worth seeing for the cast, set, and overall level of bizarreness."
24823,"""The Sentinel"" is not a great horror film, but it does offer some interesting moments......."
24824,"One of my all-time favorite movies of all time, even if it's been 9 years since I've seen it. It's still one of my all-time favorites."
24825,"A little better than I thought it would be, but still a good horror flick. I'll give it a ""8"" rating if I can."
24826,"One of my favorite horror films. It's a rich, classy production boasting an excellent cast of ensemble actors, beautiful on-location cinematography, a haunting musical score, an intelligent and novel plot theme, and an atmosphere of dread and menace"
24827,"One of the best horror movies of the '70's, if you're a fan of ""Mad Mad Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" movies, you'll love this one!"
24828,"A strange but compelling dip into the realm of evil.. but it's not all bad, and still can provide some low-key shock value."
24829,One of the better films of its type...and one of the best director's of the last decade...and it's not just because it's Michael Winner!
24830,"It's OK, but it's not your average '70s exploitation movie. Still, it's an enjoyable movie, especially for those viewers who enjoy stargazing."
24831,"One of the best Horror films I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen in a long, long time."
24832,"Unbelievably creepy, but with a darker side to it........."
24833,"""The Sentinel"" is one of Michael Winner's best films, and one of the best occult Horrors of the '70s. It's also one of his best!"
24834,"Ahh, yes, the all-star blockbuster. Take a so-so concept and load it down with every single freakin' special effect that the Wizards of Hollyweird can conjure up..."
24835,"One of the best 70's horror films I've seen in a long, long time........."
24836,"One of my all time favorites from the 70's. It's a very odd, campy but in the end, I truly believe a great film!"
24837,One of the best horror films of the 70s. She is realistic settings and atmospheres. As usual it was inevitable the usual negative comments. I have noticed that most horror films of a certain period many times fail to reach even sufficiency
24838,"There are two versions of this same film. I'm surprised that no one yet has mentioned that there are two versions of this same film. The lion's share of the footage in both is identical, but here is where they differ"
24839,"""The Sentinel"" is a genuinely creepy horror flick. Aided by a brilliant ensemble cast, a subtle storyline, and excellent makeup FX by Dick Smith."
24840,"Italian-French remake turns up the heat early, and doesn't let us come up for air. The story is about a high-school student who can't keep his eyes off the mysteriously beautiful young woman who lives next door to"
24841,An intriguing film about the destructive qualities of all-consuming passions...but it's hampered by a gratuitous oral sex scene that derails the focus on the story.
24842,"Marushka Detmars is erotic, but so is everyone else in the film. The sexy parts are pretty erotic, not so much because one of them is explicit, but because we've gotten to know the"
24843,"I loved the the film. it beautifully analyzes Italian petty bourgeois society, how the leftists of the 70s have given up all their ideals and come to a happy arrangement which they don't want disturbed."
24844,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time, not just because of the nudity but because it's so sexy!"
24845,the movie is far more sophisticated and intelligent than such American attempts as 9 and a half weeks...the courtroom scene itself...is amazing...I have not seen this movie in 20 years...but it made indelible pictures in my mind
24846,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time - and one of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time!"
24847,A great example of the life of a Japanese woman in her 20's and 30's......
24848,"This is Kurosawa's work of is life, and I'm sure that the director understood the silent meaning of Kurosawa's piece to the right intellectual range"
24849,"A wonderful film to watch with astonishing scenes and talented actors, such as Misa Shimizu and Nagiko Tono. After 15 minutes of watching, your eyes get locked on the screen and you do nothing but breathing in the atmosphere of"
24850,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and I've seen it more than once......"
24851,This is a very realistic film about the life of geishas in old Japan. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a realistic romance or life in old Japan.
24852,A visually stunning transformation of word to image. Director Kei Kumai pays homage to both Akira Kurasawa and Shugoro Yamamoto in presenting this visually stunning transformation of word to image.
24853,"""The Sea is Watching"" is one of the best movies I've ever seen..a must for any Kurosawa fan..a must for any movie collection."
24854,one of the best movies i have ever seen in a long time..a must see for all that love a samurai film..a must see for all that love a great story line and plot.
24855,This is a must see for anyone who has never seen a Japanese film before.. and for those who are familiar with the culture and time period in which this film takes place..
24856,"A wonderful movie about a brothel in a fishing village, that could be best described with scene constellations and direction of old Kurosawa's works, combined with Dostoyevski's topics of human psychology (O-shin - Sonia Marmela"
24857,This is a very fine and poetic story. Beautiful scenery. Magnificent music score. It's a real feel good movie and I can only recommend it to everybody
24858,"One of Kurosawa's best films, and one of the best of all time. A must-see for any movie buff, even if you're not a Kurosawa fan."
24859,"The Sea Is Watching is a lush and warm film, but it is no Kurosawa. To expect that might well be very silly. To expect that might well be"
24860,"Beautiful, but not quite as good as some of Kurasawa's other movies...but it's still a great movie!...but not quite as good as Streets Of Shame!"
24861,An interesting look at prostitution in Japan in the 19th century.<n>An interesting glimpse into the darker side of the geisha (as opposed to the geisha)
24862,"Borzage's ""celestial"" version is better than Lang's.<n>The theme of the train is more convincing than the ""up above"" heavenly world."
24863,"A flawed version of Molnar's play, but a great visual version of the show.<n>A great performance by Rose Hobart as Julie, and a great performance by H.B. Warner as the celestial train."
24864,Just what i want from a classic movie. Just what i want from a classic movie. Facial expressions are worth the whole film. Don't know what more you need in a film.
24865,"Joan Fontaine at her very best in this Victorian era film. I highly recommend this film. Also in the film is Joan's mother, Lillian Fontaine as Lady Flora."
24866,The Gretorexes don't know where their next shilling is coming from but there are yachting parties and fancy-dress balls in posh pleasaunces aplenty to tempt her
24867,"An excellent period murder melodrama, with Fontaine effectively playing against her earlier naive wallflower type, in a role that reportedly Olivia DeHavilland turned down."
24868,"Fontaine is great, but some others, particularly Richard Ney, are exceedingly wooden. Ney lies in bed, dying of arsenical poisoning, with every hair in place."
24869,"Does anyone know where this film was shot? The aviation scene on the cliff is beautiful. It appears to be England. However, Ivy's apartment building certainly looks like the Brill Building, with..."
24870,"One of the best film noirs I've seen in a long time, with Fontaine at the top of the list of the stars......"
24871,A humorous parody that slices to the main point of its reference.brbrI think this short-bread of a film should be enjoyed as an appetizer for the title reference and the viewer should relax roll with it.
24872,"A tribute to the original, not an insult. This film is intended to be funny, and many others who I have heard chant for and applaud it agree with me that it succeeds. Especially for those of us who have seen NOTLD 50+"
24873,"This is a great parody of Night of the Living Dead, even better than Night of the Day of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Attack of the Attack of the"
24874,"If you haven't seen Night of the Living Dead, don't watch this movie... it's a total waste of time and money.."

24876,Hong Kong's first real crossover hit in the West..........
24877,"One of the best martial arts movies I've seen in a long, long time......."
24878,"Chinese GHOST STORY is the quintessential romantic tale. It has high tragedy, because we know that Chio Sin and Sin Seen can never be together. It's about becoming mature, for none of us can mature until we've experienced"
24879,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.........
24880,"This is the best Chinese movie I have ever seen, and, in my opinion, a lot better than Hero or Chrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."
24881,A genre-mixture with ingredients of the Action-/Horror-/Romantic-/Comedygenre. It is a genre-mixture with ingredients of the Action-/Horror-/Romantic-/Comedygenre.
24882,"A brilliant mix of fantasy, comedy, romance, horror, erotic, scary and martial arts. The story about the power of love is pretty touching and warm."
24883,"One of the best ghost stories I've ever seen in a long time, and one of the best martial arts films I've seen in a long time."
24884,One of the most influential titles made in 1980s. The art set decoration and other aesthetic facets are all mesmerizing. More fantastically the movie had a total black humorous undertone in it.

24898,"One of the best Chinese movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best I've seen since ""The Bride with White Hair"""
24899,"this is a great movie. i like it where ning climbs down to get his ink, and the skeletons chase him, but luckily he dodged them, opened the window, and didn't even notice them."
24900,One of the funniest films I've seen in a long time. I'll watch it over and over again......
24901,"Chinese Ghost Story is one of the best films of all time by Ching Siu Tung, but there are some flaws in the story and in the script."
24902,"An excellent early talkie, with a straight-from-the-heart performance by Garbo. She looks very beautiful in this film, her face shines throughout, especially when Cameraman William Daniels, gets those gorgeous close-ups of her"
24903,Greta Garbo again plays Anna Christie in this German version of Anna Christie. It's a good tale and a must-see for Garbo fans.
24904,"Garbo's second portrayal of ""Anna Christie"" benefited from practice and her apparent ease with German dialog. Garbo appears more relaxed and natural under Jacques Feyder's direction than under Clarence Brown's."
24905,GARBO TALKS! GARBO TALKS! GARBO TALKS! GARBO TALKS! GARBO TALKS! GARBO TALKS! GARBO TALKS! GARBO TALKS!
24906,"Still the same O'Neill play, but Garbo's more commanding in this version of Anna Christie.<n>It's interesting to see both films in succession because they are blocked out exactly the same way (not only the sets"
24907,"The film's biggest failing is its script. It has of wit and irony. But without the poetry and irony regular Carne collaborator Jacques Prevert brought to their best films, it cannot avoid slipping into cliche."
24908,"""Hotel du Nord "" is the only Carné movie from the 1936-1946 era which has dialogs not written by Jacques Prévert,but by Henri Jeanson.Janson was much more interested in the Jouvet/Arletty"
24909,"One of Marcel Carne's most beautiful films...but it needs a few viewings to get it all in place. A bit choppy at times, but so lovely to fall into any inanity can be accepted."
24910,"This is an excellent film, and is the sort of treasure that one can only catch through sporadic cinema showings, as it is unavailable on video/DVD"
24911,"I love this movie, Jouvet, Arletty, Blier, Carné... almost everything has already been said about the movie, but there is one detail I'd like to shed some light..."
24912,A true classic. Beautifully filmed and acted. Reveals an area of Paris which is alive and filled with comedy and tragedy. It is not as gay (in the original sense of the word) and as it once must have been.
24913,Hotel Du Nord is a gripping drama of guilt in which Marcel Carne portrayed an entertaining tale of ill-fated love which also functions as a revolt against the cruel world.The film is based entirely on a pair of hapless lovers.Pierre and Renee
24914,"A very good film, with a great acting performance by Jeremy Irons, Winona Ryder, Glenn Close, and a fine performance by Miguel Guilherme."
24915,"A gripping tale of family intrigue, South American politics and super-natural powers. Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons bring Isabel Allende's novel to life with all its passion and suspense."
24916,"It's not really about Mary-Kate and Ashley, it's about inspiring young girls to be creative, intuitive, and driven...."
24917,this movie is the best movie ever it has a lot of live action. It's just great everyone should watch it and the actor are great the location is Rome Italy thats the best place ever the actors are great

24922,"Good, old-fashioned scary movie...that's rather rare nowadays.                 "
24923,"""Dark Remains"" is a pretty decent indie horror flick.It offers some genuine scares and plenty of tension.The acting is fairly good and the cinematography is great.7 out of 10"
24924,"This movie was very good. If you are one who likes to watch horror movies, I recommend it. The acting was very good although I thought that the actress playing Julie could have had more emotion behind her lines."
24925,Creepy but not as scary as some of the other movies I've seen but it was still good enough to make me jump out of my seat.
24926,One of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time.........
24927,One of the rare movies that doesn't shy away from the death of a child. Let me make note of this death - this is one of the rare movies that doesn't shy away from the death of a child.
24928,"Dark Remains is a home run plain and simple. The film is full of creepy visuals, and scares' that will make the most seasoned horror veteran jump straight out of there seat."
24929,"A very jumpy, tense, and very scary film! It's not a Hollywood blockbuster, nore does it have a huge budget, but please don't let that put you off! Just give it a try!"
24930,"A very good old-fashioned ghost movie! It's very creepy and has numerous moments that will make you jump out of seat! I had to smoke several ""emergency"" cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves!"
24931,This movie scared the crap out of me! Very suspenseful and a great movie to rent with a bunch of friends who love to watch movies curled up on a sofa screaming like little girls!

24942,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
24943,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've seen it a few times, but never watched it with my kids."
24944,"Good story, good acting, good editing, good cinematography, good editing, good editing, and good acting........."
24945,i've lost my dad when i was young and this movie surely did touch me.. i can feel the lost that the little girl Desi felt..
24946,"The best movie i've seen in a long time, and it's not based on a true story....."
24947,It's cheesy and predictable but also makes you feel good about the world again. It's cheesy and predictable but also makes you feel good about the world again.
24948,"The first Jean Renoir Silent film I have watched and perhaps rightly so since it is generally regarded to be his best, besides being also his first major work. Overall, it is indeed a very assured and technically accomplished film which belies the fact"
24949,"Renoir's ""Rules of the Game"" meets ""Rules of the Game"" and ""Rules of the Game"" meets ""Rules of the Game"" in ""Whirlpool of Fate"""
24950,A classic Australian Story! A classic Australian Story! A classic Noni Hazlehurst! A classic Australian Story! A classic Noni Hazlehurst! A classic Australian Story! A classic Australian Story! A classic Noni Hazlehurst
24951,"Noni Hazlehurst, Colin Friels, Alice Garner, Chrissie Amphlett and Michael Caton- what more could you ask for? Monkey Grip"
24952,"Stunning performance by Hazlehurst, Garner and Friels in James Cameron's adaptation of Garner's novel....."
24953,"Noni Hazlehurst's tour-de-force performance. Colin Friels is also good. Alice Garner appears as Noni's child, and Michael Caton (best known for THE CASTLE) is a bearded painter."
24954,"One of the best French films of the 60's, and one of the best westerns of the 70's, with two great male leads."
24955,"One of Bronson and Delon's best roles, but Brigitte Fossey's hair is the worst              "
24956,One of my favourite movies in it's kind. The interaction between respectable and morally uncorruptable characters is an ode to chivalry and the honour code amongst thieves and policemen.
24957,"Utterly tactical, strange (watch for the kinky moment of a drop-dead gorgeous blonde acting as pull-string doll for some rich folks), pointless but undoubtedly compelling late-night feature"
24958,One of the best heist movies I've seen in a long time.........
24959,One of my favorite movies in it's kind. The interaction between respectable and morally strong characters is an ode to chivalry and the honor code amongst thieves and policemen.
24960,"I'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I don't think I've seen every episode. Now, in conclusion, I hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good."
24961,"This was the kind of program that had ""Not Gonna Make It"" written allover it from the first episode - it was like an arcade video game where you actually have to read the instructions to play"
24962,A step or two better than Lara Croft: The Tomb of the Unknown                 
24963,"This is the real ""Modesty Blaise."" Alexandra Staden is very good in the role. It's a long way from Joe Losey's 1966 travesty, and it takes our Modesty quite seriously."
24964,"I loved it when I first saw it and I love it still. It seems it never made enough money to motivate anyone to do a follow-up. I have to assume QT still controls the rights, but after Kill Bill if he does"
24965,The Best Modesty Film I've Seen -- and I've Seen It More Than Any Other Movie I've Seen -- And I've Seen It More Than Any Other Movie I've Seen!
24966,"A good Modesty Blaise movie, which not only tells a story, but actually tells the ""real"" story. So are you a fan then sit down relax and just enjoy that the real story is there with a cover story just to make"
24967,"I'm a Modesty fan, and this one ROCKS! :D I can't wait until the real adventure begins in the next movie/FIC!"
24968,"""My Name is Modesty"" is good, but not as good as the comics or the novels. But it's still worth a look. It shows the strength of the character."
24969,"A good introduction to the character and her background. It delivered, in a captivating way, a good introduction to the character and her background.brbrAlthough it has some action flick elements, it is much more an intimate play,"
24970,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.........
24971,"The best Modesty Blaise movie I have seen so far. It's like a good pilot for a TV-series. I even think it's a little bit ""cult"""
24972,"A faithful version of Peter O'Donnell's best work. A must see for any Modesty fan. A little slow, but not too bad."
24973,"Not bad, but not great, but better than the two previous films. The movie isn't great, but it holds your interest. On the DVD extras, the interview with Quentin Tarentino, who is obviously stoned, is"
24974,This was the Modesty that we didn't know! It was hinted at and summarized in the comic strip for the syndicates to sell to newspapers!
24975,Modesty and Miklos in a game of roulette with their lives in jeopardy.brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
24976,"A very good movie, but Alexandra Staden's performance may be the key to the success of this one....."
24977,"The movie was a long awaited release, which where a bit disappointing because of the expectation's I had set up. When looking at it again I must say it is actually pretty OK. First of all is it very true to the original"
24978,"Miramax's version of the book is better than the film, if you're a fan of the book... and you're a fan of Alexandra Staden!"
24979,"A good movie, but not as good as the first one. I'm not sure what the next one will be. I'm looking forward to it."
24980,I was pleased to see that she had black hair! I've been a fan for about 30 years now and have been disgusted at the two earlier attempts to film the stories.
24981,One of the best films I've seen in a long time. I'm looking forward to the next one. Alexandra Staden is stunning as Modesty.
24982,"Very faithful to the ""history"" of the Modesty Blaise comic books and books. Alexandra Staden makes a very believable young Modesty who actually looks a lot like Modesty is supposed to look. A welcome change from the travesty of the"
24983,"Not the same kind of schlock as the previous Modesty Blaise movie, but it's still worth watching.<n>Nikolaj-Alexandra-Waldau was the perfect choice for a Blaise bad-guy, in that he made the"
24984,"Jolie, Hutton, and DUCHOVNY are the best actors on the screen right now........"
24985,One of the best action movies I've seen in a long time. A must see for people bored with the same old action movies. A must see for people bored with the same old action movie.
24986,David Duchovny plays the lead role in this film.Now a lot of people upon finding that fact out wouldn't even bother watching it.Very unfair to say the...
24987,"I enjoyed this movie. Unlike like some of the pumped up, steroid trash that is passed off as action movies, Playing God is simple and realistic, with characters that are believable, action that is not over the top and enough twists and turns"
24988,"It's a good film, but it's not quite as good as it could've been......"
24989,David Duchovney's best role since Californication - a thriller worth seeing.......
24990,A hidden surprise. I liked everything in this movie. Look its Hollywood all right but the brighter side. Angelina Jolie is great in this and I'm totally watching every movie with her in that I can get my hands on.
24991,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and a great performance by David Duchovney as the Agent Molder...."

24993,"It's a very entertaining small crime film with interesting characters, excellent portrayals, writing that's breezy without being glib, and a good pace."
24994,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. David is the best. He's the best actor I've ever seen.
24995,"Unintelligible, unsubtle, unsubtle, unsubtle, unsubtle, unsubtle, unsubtle, unsubtle, unsubtle, unintelligible, unintelligible, unintelligible, unintelligible"
24996,"I love this movie like no other. Another time I will try to explain its virtues to the uninitiated, but for the moment let me quote a few..."
